[2014-01-29 14:20:07] freynaud_: nirvdrum: you don't have to specify it
[2014-01-29 14:20:28] freynaud_: if you don't, it will pick the first one it finds
[2014-01-29 14:20:43] freynaud_: only the bundename / id is mandatory
[2014-01-29 14:22:35] nirvdrum: I see that now.  For some reason I thought it was mandatory.
[2014-01-29 14:22:39] nirvdrum: Thanks.
