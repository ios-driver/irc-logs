[2014-01-31 02:17:06] dgrace: freynaud_: is there a way to query the driver to find out if it is currently using nativeEvents or not?
[2014-01-31 02:17:16] freynaud_: yes
[2014-01-31 02:20:10] freynaud_: https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/blob/dev/server/src/test/java/org/uiautomation/ios/e2e/config/AugmenterTest.java#L46
[2014-01-31 02:20:47] freynaud_: the Configuration interface should give you access to how each command is configured
[2014-01-31 02:21:50] dgrace: cool, merci beaucoup!
[2014-01-31 02:22:28] freynaud_: pas de probl√®me
[2014-01-31 02:55:24] dgrace: is there a global way to set nativeEvents to say false for all commands, click(), sendkeys() etc?
[2014-01-31 02:55:39] dgrace: was looking at this

[2014-01-31 02:56:22] dgrace: but does not seem to do the trick
