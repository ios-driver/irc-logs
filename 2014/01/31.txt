[2014-01-31 02:17:06] dgrace: freynaud_: is there a way to query the driver to find out if it is currently using nativeEvents or not?
[2014-01-31 02:17:16] freynaud_: yes
[2014-01-31 02:20:10] freynaud_: https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/blob/dev/server/src/test/java/org/uiautomation/ios/e2e/config/AugmenterTest.java#L46
[2014-01-31 02:20:47] freynaud_: the Configuration interface should give you access to how each command is configured
[2014-01-31 02:21:50] dgrace: cool, merci beaucoup!
[2014-01-31 02:22:28] freynaud_: pas de probl√®me
[2014-01-31 02:55:24] dgrace: is there a global way to set nativeEvents to say false for all commands, click(), sendkeys() etc?
[2014-01-31 02:55:39] dgrace: was looking at this
[2014-01-31 02:55:44] dgrace: https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/Y4rJHboY
[2014-01-31 02:56:22] dgrace: but does not seem to do the trick
[2014-01-31 04:37:31] freynaud_: it should
[2014-01-31 04:38:22] freynaud_: SET_VALUE and SEND_KEYS both exist
[2014-01-31 04:38:32] freynaud_: are you sure you're talking to the right one
[2014-01-31 05:02:59] dgrace: when I use SET_VALUE as above and check the configuration of  CLICK c.getGonfiguration(WebDriverLikeCommand.CLICK), nativeEvents returns true. I need to explicitly setConfiguration for CLICK
[2014-01-31 05:03:30] dgrace: was hoping I could just use c.setConfiguration(WebDriverLikeCommand.SET_VALUE, "nativeEvents", false); and all the other commands would use nativeEvents as false
[2014-01-31 05:03:58] dgrace: until I set it back, i.e. got back to the native part of the hybrid app
