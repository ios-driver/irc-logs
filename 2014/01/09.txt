[2014-01-09 06:38:17] rsalvador: freynaud: for our internal tests we are using atoms for clicks, but with my last checking in the "refactor" branch I got all but 2 selenium tests passing, the 2 failures looked more like setup problems, I am rerunning now
[2014-01-09 07:10:45] rsalvador: freynaud: the reason there were 2 failures yesterday is because a bunch of tests got skipped, for the selenium tests I get 16 failures out of 212 tests run
