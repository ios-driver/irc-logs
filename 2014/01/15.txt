[2014-01-15 07:52:31] phasze: "instruments" occasionaly asks for permission to run when I run native tests, any way to fix that?
[2014-01-15 07:54:09] nirvdrum: phasze: Take a look at the project's .travis.yml.  Running those steps in pre-Mavericks worked for me.

[2014-01-15 07:55:02] phasze: pre-maverick is before 10.9 right?
[2014-01-15 07:55:06] phasze: I'm running 10.9.1
[2014-01-15 07:55:50] nirvdrum: Yeah.  Then some of those steps will help, but Apple changed some internal stuff.
[2014-01-15 07:56:29] phasze: nirvdrum: I take it I need the source to see the projects .travis.yml?
[2014-01-15 07:56:55] nirvdrum: A web browser will suffice :-)
[2014-01-15 07:56:59] nirvdrum: https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/blob/dev/.travis.yml
[2014-01-15 07:57:41] phasze: awesome, I'll run those commands and fix up any I need to, thanks nirvdrum!
[2014-01-15 07:58:33] nirvdrum: In particular, nicegraham indicated the /etc/authorization file doesn't contain one of the permission bits you'd need to tweak now.
[2014-01-15 07:58:43] phasze: hmm
[2014-01-15 07:58:46] nirvdrum: I don't know if anyone's investigated how to do it or not.
[2014-01-15 07:58:50] nirvdrum: But, try it and see.
[2014-01-15 08:03:22] phasze: nirvdrum: heh, yeah. /etc/authorization doesn't exist for me
[2014-01-15 08:08:19] phasze: probably because I need the sim_access.py file lol
[2014-01-15 08:08:23] phasze: looks like that creates it

[2014-01-15 08:24:41] nicegraham: nirvdrum, phasze: I think this covers it http://www.afp548.com/2013/10/22/modifying-the-os-x-mavericks-authorization-database/
[2014-01-15 08:25:10] phasze: nirvdrum: so what exactly do I have to do?
[2014-01-15 08:25:35] nicegraham: when you find out can you document it somewhere? :)
[2014-01-15 08:25:42] phasze: lol
[2014-01-15 08:25:48] phasze: and by nirvdrum I mean nicegraham :P
[2014-01-15 08:26:07] phasze: lol, I really don't know macs at all
[2014-01-15 08:26:17] phasze: this could take me a long time
[2014-01-15 08:28:51] phasze: nicegraham: so what permissions were added to etc/authorization?
[2014-01-15 08:29:02] phasze: system.privilege.taskport?
[2014-01-15 08:37:52] phasze: do I need to give everyone permission to write/read taskport?

[2014-01-15 11:09:49] Jerry_: One more annoying question: if I want the simulator's Safari to make requests through an HTTP proxy, is there an easy way to go about this that doesn't involve setting a system-wide proxy?  I tried passing -Dhttp.proxyHost and -Dhttp.proxyPort to Java when I launched the server, but this seemed to be ignored by the simulator.
[2014-01-15 11:11:15] nicegraham: it's a pain
[2014-01-15 11:11:19] nicegraham: we use cntlm
[2014-01-15 11:11:44] nicegraham: we have everything going through that and then we forward it to whatever proxy we want
[2014-01-15 11:12:02] nirvdrum: I set a system-wide proxy.  I'm not a fan.
[2014-01-15 11:12:30] nicegraham: we weren't able to figure out to do it programmatically in the simulator
[2014-01-15 11:13:27] Jerry_: Got it.  Well, at least that will save me hours of banging my head against it in ignorance.  Thank you very much for the help!

[2014-01-15 14:04:18] nicegraham: dunno lukeis
[2014-01-15 14:04:36] nicegraham: possibly fb since the only other repo they seem to have in their profile is xctool
[2014-01-15 14:06:06] lukeis: saw thatâ€¦ but who else has admin privileges to allow someone to push to the ios-driver repo?
[2014-01-15 14:06:29] lukeis: (and it was 'just' a pull request) :)
[2014-01-15 14:06:30] nicegraham: dunno, that other fb-er got the rights
[2014-01-15 14:06:40] lukeis: ah, ok
[2014-01-15 14:06:47] nicegraham: given them out like candy freynaud is
[2014-01-15 14:06:48] lukeis: dang FB-ers ;)
[2014-01-15 14:06:57] lukeis: apparently
[2014-01-15 14:07:07] nicegraham: don't talk to nirvdrum about it
[2014-01-15 14:07:20] nicegraham: he was gonna kick some fb ass
[2014-01-15 14:07:52] nirvdrum: I just object to people breaking things that previously worked.
[2014-01-15 14:08:43] nicegraham: I'd say we could find some other things you object to
[2014-01-15 14:08:54] nicegraham: ;P
[2014-01-15 14:08:57] nirvdrum: Heh.
[2014-01-15 14:09:41] nirvdrum: I confuse a lot of people.  I'm quite understanding when others don't know how to do something and will always take time to help out, without prejudice.  But if I explain it 3 times and you're just not listening, then I become quite agitated.
[2014-01-15 14:10:02] nirvdrum: Or if you know you don't know, but act like you do, and thus merge shit at will, I get annoyed.
[2014-01-15 14:10:20] nirvdrum: Willful ignorance I suppose.  Or perhaps neglect.
[2014-01-15 14:11:10] nicegraham: just not giving a shit
[2014-01-15 14:12:23] nicegraham: anyway back to the original question - i don't know how that person can push direct to the repo
