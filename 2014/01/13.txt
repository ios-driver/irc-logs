[2014-01-13 08:58:47] nirvdrum: Or does dev work as well?

[2014-01-13 09:29:16] lukeis: all i know is my co-worker is primarily using the refactor branch (and that works on xcode5 / ios7 )
[2014-01-13 09:29:44] lukeis: (my coworker being roman salvador)
[2014-01-13 09:31:26] nirvdrum: Ahh.
[2014-01-13 09:31:34] nirvdrum: I saw him around but had no clue who he was.
[2014-01-13 09:32:09] lukeis: :) he's on my team (along with jim)
[2014-01-13 09:33:07] nirvdrum: Jim's going to land himself on a No Fly list soon :-P

[2014-01-13 12:40:10] nirvdrum: Ugh.
[2014-01-13 12:40:27] nirvdrum: Does the inspector work on the refactor branch?
[2014-01-13 12:40:37] nirvdrum: Or should I expect it to raise an NPE?

[2014-01-13 12:41:54] lukeis: nirvdrum: not sureâ€¦ roman is telling me to revert the atoms push I did (which I will shortly) maybe try checking out this rev: b9727e58d8c840ab82b73bae333be235697fac37
[2014-01-13 12:42:25] lukeis: (which is the one before the atoms change)
[2014-01-13 12:43:25] nirvdrum: I'll give that a shot.  Thanks.
[2014-01-13 12:44:18] AutomatedTester: nicegraham: started building the lego things around my brickpi on the weekend
[2014-01-13 12:44:24] AutomatedTester: and getting the code going
[2014-01-13 12:46:45] nirvdrum: lukeis: Nope.  I'll have to load up IDEA.
[2014-01-13 12:46:54] nirvdrum: This is a native app, FWIW.  Looking to try that out.

[2014-01-13 13:56:38] nirvdrum: lukeis: That wasn't it.  It seems the inspector has a null session and thus can't get the screenshot.

[2014-01-13 14:00:00] lukeis: ok :) but I had to do that anywaysâ€¦ since it was breaking other things ;)
[2014-01-13 14:10:59] nirvdrum: Sorry, the subtext there was have any idea why this isn't working? :-P
[2014-01-13 14:26:50] lukeis: sorry, i work on android ;)
