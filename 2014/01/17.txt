[2014-01-17 02:40:31] nicegraham: freynaud_: are we ready to do a 0.7.0 release to get maven updated with ios7 compatible code?
[2014-01-17 02:40:48] freynaud_: not all the test pass for me
[2014-01-17 02:41:12] freynaud_: dp they pass for you ?
[2014-01-17 02:41:22] nicegraham: ...no
[2014-01-17 02:42:01] nicegraham: have you checked if they're better or worse since lukeis reverted the atoms he changed?
[2014-01-17 02:43:05] freynaud_: when did he do that ?
[2014-01-17 02:43:17] freynaud_: i mainly worked on specific test error
[2014-01-17 02:43:23] freynaud_: and on the build
[2014-01-17 02:45:01] nicegraham: he did it on the refactor branch at some stage this week
[2014-01-17 02:45:05] nicegraham: maybe wednesday
[2014-01-17 02:45:15] freynaud_: haven't tried that

[2014-01-17 02:47:22] freynaud_: I'd like to finish the CI first
[2014-01-17 02:47:29] freynaud_: and let it find the failing tests
[2014-01-17 02:47:39] freynaud_: any reason from your side to keep working on refactor ?
[2014-01-17 02:47:46] freynaud_: or can we merge to dev ?
[2014-01-17 02:48:54] nicegraham: I think we should merge and close it
[2014-01-17 02:49:10] nicegraham: it's splitting the dev effort
[2014-01-17 02:49:48] freynaud_: if Luke is ok with it, I'll merge and delete refactor
[2014-01-17 02:50:49] nicegraham: i'm pretty sure the only reason we were on refactor is because it's where the ios7 updates were
[2014-01-17 02:50:54] nicegraham: most of those are now on dev
[2014-01-17 02:51:03] nicegraham: so we just need to merge the differences
[2014-01-17 02:51:25] freynaud_: do you know if poeple update xcode ?
[2014-01-17 02:51:39] freynaud_: should ios-driver 7 support both xcode4.6 and 5, or just 5
[2014-01-17 02:51:49] freynaud_: and ask people to use the old ios-driver for 4.6
[2014-01-17 02:52:49] nicegraham: *I think* it supports the older ones too
[2014-01-17 02:53:12] nicegraham: but we've updated obviously to get ios7
[2014-01-17 02:53:34] nicegraham: and I think that is the most likely use case with the way apple versions are picked up
[2014-01-17 02:53:46] nicegraham: there's never really a long tail of people updating to the latest
