[2014-01-23 11:34:34] freynaud_: rsalvador: Hi
[2014-01-23 11:34:59] rsalvador: Hi
[2014-01-23 11:35:19] freynaud_: you did all the changes for safari right ?
[2014-01-23 11:35:25] rsalvador: yes
[2014-01-23 11:35:28] freynaud_: cool
[2014-01-23 11:35:49] freynaud_: i finished merging dev and the changes I made for the native part
[2014-01-23 11:36:02] freynaud_: it's in the "merging" branch
[2014-01-23 11:36:25] freynaud_: i only have 4-5 failures now that i'm trying to troubleshoot
[2014-01-23 11:36:29] freynaud_: for native
[2014-01-23 11:36:34] rsalvador: great
[2014-01-23 11:36:47] freynaud_: can you have a look and see if it breaks anything for safari
[2014-01-23 11:36:55] freynaud_: i also notices a but for safari
[2014-01-23 11:37:08] rsalvador: sure, what is the bug?
[2014-01-23 11:37:14] freynaud_: you changed the way it's launched, with the default page going to about:blank
[2014-01-23 11:37:18] freynaud_: which makes it faster
[2014-01-23 11:37:43] freynaud_: if you run NewSessionTest#supportApplicationWithMultipleDeviceFamily
[2014-01-23 11:37:55] rsalvador: it was crashing sometimes with the default page with multiple webviews
[2014-01-23 11:38:10] freynaud_: same for me, your fix makes it more stable
[2014-01-23 11:38:19] freynaud_: but it doesn't work for the 64 bits sim
[2014-01-23 11:38:34] freynaud_: I still see the "old" page with apple and disney
[2014-01-23 11:38:53] rsalvador: ok, I can look into it
[2014-01-23 11:39:38] freynaud_: fir the 64 bits, my sim folder is /Users/freynaud/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/7.0.3-64
[2014-01-23 11:39:46] gdennis: is all the latest and greatest code moved all in the dev branch at this point?
[2014-01-23 11:40:31] freynaud_: gdennis: i worked on the merging branch today.
[2014-01-23 11:40:50] freynaud_: if rsalvador is happy with how safari behaves there, i'll merge it into dev

[2014-01-23 11:42:08] gdennis: freynaud_: thanks! any progress on the ability to specify a script that would start safari?
[2014-01-23 11:42:30] freynaud_: no, i still have to look into it
[2014-01-23 11:42:38] nirvdrum: I'm playing catch up again.  Was the refactor branch merged into dev?
[2014-01-23 11:42:58] freynaud_: nirvdrum: yes. And deleted
[2014-01-23 11:43:07] nirvdrum: Thanks.
[2014-01-23 11:43:39] freynaud_: i worked on a CI this week, and had a lot flakiness using slow VMs
[2014-01-23 11:43:51] freynaud_: most of that should be resolved, that's the merging branch
[2014-01-23 11:44:14] freynaud_: i only tested native, so safari needs to be checked before it's merge to dev and deleted
[2014-01-23 11:45:54] nirvdrum: I was trying to test a native app.  Do I have to build the app on the machine I run ios-driver on?  I wasn't able to transfer the .app file and get it to load properly.
[2014-01-23 11:46:32] freynaud_: nirvdrum: you don't have too. I have my .app checked in and i run them everywhere
[2014-01-23 11:46:47] freynaud_: you probably need to have the same xcode everywhere
[2014-01-23 11:46:51] nirvdrum: Hmm . . . I guess I did something wrong.
[2014-01-23 11:47:16] nirvdrum: And you use the command line tools to build?
[2014-01-23 11:47:22] freynaud_: i do the same everywhere, i have a setup script that prepares the machine
[2014-01-23 11:47:35] freynaud_: i usually use xcode
[2014-01-23 11:47:40] freynaud_: because it's easier
[2014-01-23 11:50:40] freynaud_: nirvdrum: how do you prepare your machines ? What's the issue with the transfering to another machine
[2014-01-23 11:51:15] nirvdrum: I don't really have a process.  I was just trying out testing an ios app for a friend.
[2014-01-23 11:51:29] nirvdrum: And I thought it'd be a good way to learn about the non-Safari side of ios-driver.
[2014-01-23 11:51:51] nirvdrum: But sometimes my .app was 876 KB, other times it was 11 MB.
[2014-01-23 11:51:58] nirvdrum: I have no idea what I'm doing.
[2014-01-23 11:52:13] nirvdrum: But I wanted to learn how to tie all this into a Jenkins process.
[2014-01-23 11:53:07] freynaud_: i can give you what i have which will do everything but compile your app
[2014-01-23 11:53:21] freynaud_: compiling the app depends on the dev team. They have magic flags
[2014-01-23 11:53:40] freynaud_: they should be able to give you how they build
[2014-01-23 11:53:44] nicegraham: nirvdrum: we use xctool to build as part of jenkins
[2014-01-23 11:53:50] nicegraham: the facebook version
[2014-01-23 11:54:02] nicegraham: https://github.com/facebook/xctool
[2014-01-23 11:56:01] nirvdrum: nicegraham: Thanks.
[2014-01-23 11:56:12] nirvdrum: I will check that out.
[2014-01-23 11:56:25] nirvdrum: freynaud_: That would be appreciated.
[2014-01-23 11:56:27] nicegraham: dgrace: could give you more details - he set it up
[2014-01-23 11:56:30] freynaud_: for the setup i use that
[2014-01-23 11:56:31] freynaud_: https://gist.github.com/freynaud/8585626
[2014-01-23 11:57:34] freynaud_: i don't need anything else on a branch new VM to start using ios-driver in a jenkins slave

[2014-01-23 12:14:27] rsalvador: freynaud_: I am trying the "merging" branch and all NewSessionTest#supportApplicationWithMultipleDeviceFamily tests are passing, the 64-bit iphone has the about:blank. What is the problem that you see?
[2014-01-23 12:20:37] gdennis: Huh, the refactor branch renamed the atoms to underscore_case but in the dev branch they appear to be renamed back to a hybrid camelCase underscore_case
[2014-01-23 12:26:14] freynaud_: rsalvador: they pass for me too
[2014-01-23 12:26:33] freynaud_: but they load your new page for norml version
[2014-01-23 12:26:37] freynaud_: and the old one for 64 bits
[2014-01-23 12:27:00] rsalvador: while I watch the tests running I see it loading the new default one for 64 bit also
[2014-01-23 12:27:01] freynaud_: it clicks on //UIAWindow/UIAScrollView/UIAButton
[2014-01-23 12:28:25] freynaud_: running them now
[2014-01-23 12:28:42] freynaud_: same again, I see disney and apple for 64
[2014-01-23 12:28:54] freynaud_: i'll debug later
[2014-01-23 12:28:59] rsalvador: I am looking at the code, one thing I see is that APPIOSApplication.getContentsAndSettingFolder uses Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/7.0.3 both for the 64 and non-64 version, is should instead use 7.0.3-64 for the 64 one
[2014-01-23 12:29:34] freynaud_: have you had a chance to run the safari tests on the merging branch ? are they ok for you
[2014-01-23 12:30:09] rsalvador: haven't had a chance, I'll try now, but it takes about 30 minutes and makes my laptop kind of unusable
[2014-01-23 12:31:42] freynaud_: ok, i'll try to plug that in the ci
[2014-01-23 12:32:14] freynaud_: it's faster to run, but vms are smaller, so it surfaces the flakiness ...

[2014-01-23 14:11:45] freynaud_: it crashes for me creating the session
[2014-01-23 14:11:53] freynaud_: when that is done, the rest goes through
[2014-01-23 14:12:18] freynaud_: because I'm running the tests for ios-driver, I spend my time creating session
[2014-01-23 14:12:24] freynaud_: maybe that's why I see it more
[2014-01-23 14:12:43] freynaud_: if I can use only 2 cores, I can have more VM per mac mini
[2014-01-23 14:12:48] freynaud_: that would be nice
