[2014-03-19 12:55:48] buritica: hey all
[2014-03-19 12:55:48] buritica: so I disovered ios-driver last night and I am really excited about it, but have been running into some issues and wanted to know if anyone here was familiar with them
[2014-03-19 12:55:49] buritica: basically, i'm using https://github.com/admc/wd/ to drive some tests
[2014-03-19 12:55:49] buritica: everything works great, except when I try to look for an element by css celector

[2014-03-19 13:08:36] buritica: i've gotten null pointers in several occasions, and I'm not very well versed with Java, so I wouldn't know where to start looking at this
[2014-03-19 13:08:36] buritica: any ideas?
