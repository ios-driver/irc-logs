[2014-03-25 12:55:25] samuelhorwitz: hey freynaud
[2014-03-25 12:55:47] samuelhorwitz: I just managed to get all the tests to run by dropping the sudo. I updated the thread
[2014-03-25 12:56:22] samuelhorwitz: but not to pollute the thread anymore, whats the best way to only run some of the tests through maven and surefire?
[2014-03-25 12:56:49] samuelhorwitz: Because right now it is running through everything and I'd like to write my own test cases now for my code without running every test
