[2014-02-13 11:57:36] samuelhorwitz: Hey all, I have a quick question about contributions and CLAs and stuff
[2014-02-13 11:58:01] samuelhorwitz: I've been doing some side work on the clock at my company to make ios-driver work with Protractor (the AngularJS testing framework)
[2014-02-13 11:58:06] samuelhorwitz: Basically executeAsyncScript stuff
[2014-02-13 11:58:31] samuelhorwitz: Anyway I'm pushing to make my changes open source and make a pull request and all that
[2014-02-13 11:58:55] samuelhorwitz: My boss is cool with the idea but he's sending the CLA thing to the lawyers to look at and also is concerned if our company will get credit
[2014-02-13 11:59:41] samuelhorwitz: Since the boilerplate code is just "ios-driver Contributers", would you all be okay if I submitted a pull request including a CONTRIBUTORS file?
[2014-02-13 11:59:54] samuelhorwitz: I really would like to make this palatable to my employer
[2014-02-13 12:00:13] samuelhorwitz: or is there somewhere else the contributors are declared that I am missing
