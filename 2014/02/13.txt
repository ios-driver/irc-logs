[2014-02-13 11:57:36] samuelhorwitz: Hey all, I have a quick question about contributions and CLAs and stuff
[2014-02-13 11:58:01] samuelhorwitz: I've been doing some side work on the clock at my company to make ios-driver work with Protractor (the AngularJS testing framework)
[2014-02-13 11:58:06] samuelhorwitz: Basically executeAsyncScript stuff
[2014-02-13 11:58:31] samuelhorwitz: Anyway I'm pushing to make my changes open source and make a pull request and all that
[2014-02-13 11:58:55] samuelhorwitz: My boss is cool with the idea but he's sending the CLA thing to the lawyers to look at and also is concerned if our company will get credit
[2014-02-13 11:59:41] samuelhorwitz: Since the boilerplate code is just "ios-driver Contributers", would you all be okay if I submitted a pull request including a CONTRIBUTORS file?
[2014-02-13 11:59:54] samuelhorwitz: I really would like to make this palatable to my employer
[2014-02-13 12:00:13] samuelhorwitz: or is there somewhere else the contributors are declared that I am missing
[2014-02-13 12:05:16] nirvdrum: samuelhorwitz: freynaud_ would be the guy to talk to.  Generally the contributors list is culled from the git authors list :-P
[2014-02-13 12:05:50] freynaud, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2014-02-13 12:05:58] nirvdrum: But the CLA isn't about credit.  It's about keeping the project's IP clean, which generally speaking is in your employer's best interest.
[2014-02-13 12:06:52] freynaud: CLA != contributor list
[2014-02-13 12:07:11] samuelhorwitz: No, no I know that
[2014-02-13 12:07:21] samuelhorwitz: I suppose I just mentioned CLA to acknowledge I know I have to have them sign it
[2014-02-13 12:07:42] samuelhorwitz: I'm just going through the steps of getting approval in general and besides the CLA, my employer wants to have our name somewhere
[2014-02-13 12:08:32] samuelhorwitz: freynaud, did you get my original question under freynaud_?
[2014-02-13 12:08:38] freynaud: no
[2014-02-13 12:08:40] samuelhorwitz: ah okay
[2014-02-13 12:08:47] freynaud: irc cloud seems down

[2014-02-13 12:08:53] samuelhorwitz: Would it be okay for a pull request to include a CONTRIBUTORS file?
[2014-02-13 12:09:07] samuelhorwitz: My employeer wants credit and I made some updates on the clock I'm looking to submit back in
[2014-02-13 12:09:21] freynaud: the clock ?
[2014-02-13 12:09:27] samuelhorwitz: At work
[2014-02-13 12:09:43] freynaud: i don't have nay issue with it
[2014-02-13 12:09:48] samuelhorwitz: Cool :)
[2014-02-13 12:09:56] freynaud: i don't think we have a contributor page yet
[2014-02-13 12:10:04] samuelhorwitz: I just need to tell them I can put their name somewhere and I don't want to clutter the boilerplate code headers
[2014-02-13 12:10:09] samuelhorwitz: Yeah you guys dont, not that I could find
[2014-02-13 12:10:19] samuelhorwitz: It would probably be good and I can report back and say I can give them credit
[2014-02-13 12:10:22] samuelhorwitz: Thank you :)
[2014-02-13 12:10:51] freynaud: i personally uses https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/graphs/contributors
[2014-02-13 12:11:51] samuelhorwitz: Yah that makes sense for actually contacting real contributers responsible for changes, but my employer is more concerned with the company's name getting some credit if they let me release work I was paid to do back into the community
[2014-02-13 12:12:18] samuelhorwitz: I'll include everyone on their in my initial CONTRIBUTORS commit to be edited as desired by contributors
[2014-02-13 12:12:42] samuelhorwitz: there*
[2014-02-13 12:15:21] nirvdrum: samuelhorwitz: employers can be fun like that.
[2014-02-13 12:15:36] samuelhorwitz: haha
[2014-02-13 12:16:37] nirvdrum: I can empathize with wanting credit. At the same time, there was a lot of ios-driver code you guys didn't have to write ;-)
[2014-02-13 12:16:54] nirvdrum: but this seems like a small hurdle to clear.
[2014-02-13 12:17:49] samuelhorwitz: Yeah I agree
[2014-02-13 12:17:57] samuelhorwitz: My file will include everyone on that link above
[2014-02-13 12:18:01] samuelhorwitz: before our names
[2014-02-13 12:18:53] freynaud: we can have a companies contributing page
[2014-02-13 12:19:00] freynaud: less maintenance than a list of people
[2014-02-13 12:19:11] freynaud: the list of people you already have from github
[2014-02-13 12:19:52] samuelhorwitz: If you'd rather have that I'm down
[2014-02-13 12:19:59] samuelhorwitz: I'd feel bad just having my company's entry there though
[2014-02-13 12:20:05] samuelhorwitz: But I can preface it with a link to the github page
[2014-02-13 12:21:53] freynaud: what changes have you made btw?
[2014-02-13 12:23:09] samuelhorwitz: Basically, I have a project in AngularJS
[2014-02-13 12:23:14] samuelhorwitz: And I wanted to use Protractor with it
[2014-02-13 12:23:22] samuelhorwitz: so that required some async script execution stuff
[2014-02-13 12:23:26] samuelhorwitz: https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/issues/172
[2014-02-13 12:23:35] samuelhorwitz: That was a feature request someone else made about it
[2014-02-13 12:24:14] samuelhorwitz: Honestly if my stuff is rubbish I don't care if people pick it apart or discard it, it works for me but this is my first dive into webdriver code
[2014-02-13 12:24:36] samuelhorwitz: I'm making a thing about it because I know other people want these changes and I want my company to let me at least put out what ive done so far
[2014-02-13 12:24:45] samuelhorwitz: And to do that I need to make sure their demands are met lol
[2014-02-13 12:25:03] samuelhorwitz: I don't want to come off as sounding grandiose needing my own CONTRIBUTORS file and all of that
[2014-02-13 12:25:59] freynaud: is there an atom for asyn script ?
[2014-02-13 12:26:17] freynaud: or a wkrdp protocol call for it?
[2014-02-13 12:27:12] samuelhorwitz: I dont believe there is an atom
[2014-02-13 12:27:37] samuelhorwitz: It's something specified in the webdriver spec and there were some empty functions and commented out routing bits for it
[2014-02-13 12:31:31] freynaud: what will the callback be ?
[2014-02-13 12:31:49] freynaud: JS or can you pass anything in the language binding you use ?
[2014-02-13 12:32:12] samuelhorwitz: You mean the final argument callback for the executed script?
[2014-02-13 12:32:20] freynaud: yes
[2014-02-13 12:32:50] freynaud: i don't have an example in mind or where that would be usefull
[2014-02-13 12:33:02] freynaud: the protocol is about emulating users
[2014-02-13 12:33:07] samuelhorwitz: Its a remote object javascript function
[2014-02-13 12:33:12] freynaud: a user doesn't have callbacks
[2014-02-13 12:33:34] samuelhorwitz: this is the selenium documentation for the function
[2014-02-13 12:33:35] samuelhorwitz: http://selenium.googlecode.com/git/docs/api/java/org/openqa/selenium/JavascriptExecutor.html
[2014-02-13 12:33:53] samuelhorwitz: The issue is that Protractor uses it for booting up and waiting for AngularJS to be ready on the page
[2014-02-13 12:33:58] samuelhorwitz: I'm not actually using it directly
[2014-02-13 12:34:08] samuelhorwitz: Thats why the protractor users are all waiting for its implementation
[2014-02-13 12:34:41] samuelhorwitz: So when you are testing Angularjs with chromedriver or whatever it all works fine but when you use the current ios-driver, it crashes because these methods arent implemented
[2014-02-13 12:35:49] freynaud: ok
[2014-02-13 12:35:58] freynaud: first step is to get the CLA signed
[2014-02-13 12:36:09] samuelhorwitz: yeah
[2014-02-13 12:36:26] samuelhorwitz: oh and I guess my branch also has a slight change to callbacks for execute script
[2014-02-13 12:36:35] samuelhorwitz: not callbacks but arguments i mean
[2014-02-13 12:36:43] samuelhorwitz: You couldnt pass an array as an argument for some reason
[2014-02-13 12:36:44] samuelhorwitz: now you can
[2014-02-13 12:36:55] samuelhorwitz: was there any reason for this before? it would just throw an error
[2014-02-13 12:36:55] freynaud: and the tests pass ?
[2014-02-13 12:37:07] freynaud: webkit remote protocol doesn't allow arrays
[2014-02-13 12:37:22] samuelhorwitz: Well I pass them as remote objects
[2014-02-13 12:37:22] freynaud: arrays are changed to an object, and you get a reference to it
[2014-02-13 12:37:29] freynaud: you cannot call .length etc
[2014-02-13 12:38:59] samuelhorwitz: I will write test cases before I submit a pull request :/ Good point
[2014-02-13 12:40:17] samuelhorwitz: I'll tell you what, since this stuff is probably going to want to be discussed a bit more, I'll get everything ironed out on my end and create a public fork of my changes I link to on that feature request before I go all out and actually submit a pull request
[2014-02-13 12:40:50] freynaud: ok
[2014-02-13 12:40:55] freynaud: sounds like a plan
[2014-02-13 12:41:17] samuelhorwitz: Since although I'm proud of the fact I got this up and running for Protractor, I feel like I'm probably not experienced enough with the code base to have a perfect final product
[2014-02-13 12:41:27] samuelhorwitz: cool sounds good
[2014-02-13 12:42:03] samuelhorwitz: Thanks for your help and sorry again about the requests on behalf of my employer, I know it sounds like I'm asking for adoration before I've even shown anything for it or whatever
