[2014-02-10 10:39:48] samhorwitz: Hey I'm trying to run the tests for ios-driver and I keep getting these weird errors
[2014-02-10 10:39:51] samhorwitz: WARNING NewSessionNHandler.handle  Couldn't start instrument :Didn't get the capability back.
[2014-02-10 10:40:12] samhorwitz: The simulator starts and then the test application opens halfway and hangs (the "zoom to fit screen
[2014-02-10 10:40:22] samhorwitz:  " animation plays but stops halway through
[2014-02-10 10:40:34] samhorwitz: Then it seems instruments cant connect and crashes and the tests dont run
[2014-02-10 10:40:49] samhorwitz: Otherwise, I can build fine and I can run the JAR file fine
[2014-02-10 10:41:05] samhorwitz: Also the tests worked on Friday when I first built without -DskipTests but now they just dont.

[2014-02-10 12:16:15] nirvdrum: weird. It was working one day and then all of a sudden stopped.
[2014-02-10 12:23:50] samhorwitz: Yeah, it definitely looks to be crashing visually
[2014-02-10 12:24:19] samhorwitz: The launch of that custom App bundled with ios-driver is obviously failing
[2014-02-10 12:24:26] samhorwitz: When it launches
[2014-02-10 12:24:34] samhorwitz: It does the launch animation and hangs halfway in
[2014-02-10 12:26:15] samhorwitz: wait I just realized you are responding to mirvdrum, did you have the same issue?
