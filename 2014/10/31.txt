[2014-10-31 07:22:38] NuUser: I'm running into issues trying to get ios-driver working with the Selenium Grid
[2014-10-31 07:24:36] NuUser: After initiating the connection to the grid using "java -jar ios-server-0.6.5-jar-with-dependencies.jar -hub http://<hub ip>:4444/grid/register -proxy org.uiautomation.ios.grid.IOSRemoteProxy -host <local ip> -port 5555"
[2014-10-31 07:25:12] NuUser: how does one specify the capabilities?
[2014-10-31 07:25:27] NuUser: of either safari or a physical iPad app?
