[2014-10-23 11:33:19] DatNewb: I'm writing tests in Java on a Windows machine to connect to the Selenium Grid and run on a Mac with an iPad attached. In my test, I do "DesiredCapabilities cap = IOSCapabilities.ipad("InternationalMountains");"
[2014-10-23 11:33:46] DatNewb: the "IOSCapabilities" is not found since I have not added the correct library
[2014-10-23 11:34:32] DatNewb: was wonder what the correct library is since it is not mentioned in the documentation (http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/?page=scaling)
[2014-10-23 11:34:41] DatNewb: *wondering
[2014-10-23 11:35:23] DatNewb: I've tried adding ios-driver 0.6.5 to my maven dependency
[2014-10-23 11:35:33] DatNewb: didnt work for me
[2014-10-23 11:35:37] lukeis: it's in 'common'  ios-common
[2014-10-23 11:36:01] lukeis: ios-driver hasn't had a release in a while, you will likely need to build yourself and add the jar
[2014-10-23 11:37:20] DatNewb: ok, i'll give that a try
[2014-10-23 11:37:20] DatNewb: thanks
[2014-10-23 11:52:20] DatNewb: addind "ios-common" in the <artifactId> fixed it for me

[2014-10-23 13:58:42] mach6: ^rebased
[2014-10-23 14:02:25] lukeis: â€¦.. windows? :-P
[2014-10-23 14:02:43] mach6: yep.. ppl need to still compile the source
[2014-10-23 14:02:48] mach6: regardless of platform
[2014-10-23 14:03:04] lukeis: define 'ppl' ;)
[2014-10-23 14:03:16] mach6: lol
[2014-10-23 14:03:54] mach6: well lets say someone that wants to depend on the latest ios-driver snapshot and is developing on a windows box. that help
[2014-10-23 14:03:55] mach6: ?
[2014-10-23 14:04:12] lukeis: iOS + windows does not compute :)
[2014-10-23 14:04:24] mach6: or wants to publish the latest ios-driver snapshot to a local maven repo
[2014-10-23 14:04:30] mach6: i know it doens't compute for runtime
[2014-10-23 14:04:46] lukeis: tell them to get a mac? ;)
[2014-10-23 14:04:47] mach6: but as a dependency and for building (w/o) tests.. it's perfectly reasonable imo
[2014-10-23 14:05:11] lukeis: i seriously question the reasonable part of that :)

[2014-10-23 14:05:42] ios-driver-git, leaving. (#ios-driver)
[2014-10-23 14:06:45] mach6: hmm. while i agree that a mac makes more sense , i'm not sure I agree that a mvn based build should be broken to non mac platforms.. running tests is one thing. but compiling?
[2014-10-23 14:07:14] lukeis: eh, i don't really see the point of them doing it at all
[2014-10-23 14:07:16] mach6: anyhow looks like it is merged. so i thank u sir
[2014-10-23 14:07:46] lukeis: if the point is to build the latest snapshot to push to a staging repo like nexusâ€¦ i would still do it on mac in a CI environment
[2014-10-23 14:08:03] mach6: assuming you have a mac in a ci environment
[2014-10-23 14:08:06] mach6: not everyone does
[2014-10-23 14:08:21] lukeis: everyone should :)
[2014-10-23 14:08:46] mach6: course if the snapshot was puclished to oss.sonatype.org we wouldnt have this conversation :)
[2014-10-23 14:08:48] lukeis: especially if they are doing anything with iOS / mac
[2014-10-23 14:08:57] mach6: i did tell francois i'd help with that.. probably should get started
[2014-10-23 14:08:57] lukeis: heh
