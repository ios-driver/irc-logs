[2014-10-23 11:33:19] DatNewb: I'm writing tests in Java on a Windows machine to connect to the Selenium Grid and run on a Mac with an iPad attached. In my test, I do "DesiredCapabilities cap = IOSCapabilities.ipad("InternationalMountains");"
[2014-10-23 11:33:46] DatNewb: the "IOSCapabilities" is not found since I have not added the correct library
[2014-10-23 11:34:32] DatNewb: was wonder what the correct library is since it is not mentioned in the documentation (http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/?page=scaling)
[2014-10-23 11:34:41] DatNewb: *wondering
[2014-10-23 11:35:23] DatNewb: I've tried adding ios-driver 0.6.5 to my maven dependency
[2014-10-23 11:35:33] DatNewb: didnt work for me
[2014-10-23 11:35:37] lukeis: it's in 'common'  ios-common
[2014-10-23 11:36:01] lukeis: ios-driver hasn't had a release in a while, you will likely need to build yourself and add the jar
[2014-10-23 11:37:20] DatNewb: ok, i'll give that a try
[2014-10-23 11:37:20] DatNewb: thanks
[2014-10-23 11:52:20] DatNewb: addind "ios-common" in the <artifactId> fixed it for me
