[2014-10-22 06:12:27] mmmulani: freynaud: hey, you around?
[2014-10-22 06:12:38] mmmulani: I have a work-around for scrollToVisible and want to see what you think of it :P
[2014-10-22 06:13:00] freynaud: yes
[2014-10-22 06:13:27] mmmulani: here:
[2014-10-22 06:13:27] mmmulani: https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/blob/dev/server/src/main/resources/instruments-js/UIAElement.js#L224
[2014-10-22 06:13:33] mmmulani: what if we also check !this.isVisible()
[2014-10-22 06:15:04] mmmulani: hmm actually this doesn't seem to fix it
[2014-10-22 06:15:28] mmmulani: it looks like apple code will do an "empty" scroll, which results in a tap when calling scrollToVisible
[2014-10-22 06:17:49] rodrigomartin, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2014-10-22 06:18:03] mmmulani: I guess I'll file an apple bug for this
[2014-10-22 06:20:16] freynaud: this.isVisible is broken if I remember well
[2014-10-22 06:20:32] mmmulani: yea, it seems like it only gets set after scrollToVisible() is called
[2014-10-22 06:20:49] freynaud: if you look at all the JS in that folder
[2014-10-22 06:21:02] freynaud: everything should be deleted if the apple stuff was working
[2014-10-22 06:21:10] freynaud: it's 99% working around bugs
[2014-10-22 06:21:15] mmmulani: hahahah
[2014-10-22 06:21:17] mmmulani: yeah :(
[2014-10-22 06:21:22] freynaud: or suboptimal API
[2014-10-22 06:21:29] freynaud: like rect() returning a float
[2014-10-22 06:21:45] freynaud: but click taking int etc
[2014-10-22 06:21:52] freynaud: it's glue code all around
[2014-10-22 06:22:32] mmmulani: yea
[2014-10-22 06:26:45] smccarthy, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2014-10-22 06:29:56] mmmulani: so what would break if we got rid of this.scrollToVisible() in isStale() ?
[2014-10-22 06:37:21] freynaud: not sure
[2014-10-22 06:37:33] freynaud: ii think the native stuff auto scroll anyway
[2014-10-22 06:37:48] freynaud: calling tap() doesn't require to pre-scroll
[2014-10-22 06:38:04] freynaud: isStale would be more annoying
[2014-10-22 06:38:18] freynaud: if you cache an element, and move to a new screen
[2014-10-22 06:38:34] freynaud: you can still call all methods on that element without having an exception
[2014-10-22 06:39:04] freynaud: isStale would not horribly break stuff, but it would make debugging harder by having criptic error messages I think
[2014-10-22 06:39:36] freynaud: you were not able to "fix" scrollToVisible ?
[2014-10-22 06:40:53] mmmulani: ahh
[2014-10-22 06:40:57] mmmulani: not really :(
[2014-10-22 06:42:10] mmmulani: alright I'm gonna clean up the isStale method then
