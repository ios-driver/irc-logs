[2014-10-17 06:25:21] mmmulani: freynaud: hey, you there?
[2014-10-17 06:25:26] freynaud: yes
[2014-10-17 06:25:31] mmmulani: I want to update libimobiledevice-wrapper to use com.dd.plist v1.8
[2014-10-17 06:25:36] mmmulani: should I make a PR?
[2014-10-17 06:26:04] freynaud: you don't have access ?
[2014-10-17 06:26:16] mmmulani: seems not
[2014-10-17 06:26:22] mmmulani: tried pushing and it failed
[2014-10-17 06:26:29] mmmulani: (this is to https://github.com/ios-driver/libimobiledevice-wrapper)
[2014-10-17 06:27:00] freynaud: you should have access now
[2014-10-17 06:27:05] freynaud: let me know if you don't
[2014-10-17 06:27:40] freynaud: i'm trying to cleanup to have xcode5 and 6 working, this is a mess :)
[2014-10-17 06:27:47] mmmulani: yeah :(
[2014-10-17 06:27:50] freynaud: they changes convention everywhere
[2014-10-17 06:28:00] freynaud: I've spent a day just on DeviceVariation
[2014-10-17 06:28:04] mmmulani: cool, worked
[2014-10-17 06:28:06] mmmulani: ahhh
[2014-10-17 06:28:09] freynaud: thx
[2014-10-17 06:29:25] freynaud: https://github.com/freynaud/ios-driver/blob/tmp6/common/src/main/java/org/uiautomation/ios/communication/device/DeviceVariation.java
[2014-10-17 06:29:29] freynaud: that's the new one.
[2014-10-17 06:29:48] freynaud: i want to use iphone4s everywhere for instance

[2014-10-17 06:30:04] freynaud: rather than retina_4inch which doesn't make too much sense for users
[2014-10-17 06:30:32] mmmulani: 4s is supported on ios 8?
[2014-10-17 06:30:46] freynaud: no, but I'd like to be backward compatible
[2014-10-17 06:30:55] freynaud: actually, yes it should
[2014-10-17 06:30:57] freynaud: 4 isn't
[2014-10-17 06:31:00] mmmulani: oh yeah, it is you're right
[2014-10-17 06:31:17] mmmulani: yeah the current implementation is only sort of backwards compatible
[2014-10-17 06:31:18] freynaud: i also want to remove iphone vs ipod
[2014-10-17 06:31:20] mmmulani: like old scripts still work
[2014-10-17 06:31:35] mmmulani: but you can't run stuff targeting new devices on old xcode
[2014-10-17 06:31:57] freynaud: the capability should be device:iphone5s , sdk:7.1 , sim=true
[2014-10-17 06:32:10] mmmulani: ahh
[2014-10-17 06:32:28] freynaud: all the rest is implementation details that should have not been leakied to users in the first place
[2014-10-17 06:33:16] mmmulani: (Y)
[2014-10-17 06:52:04] freynaud: a big part of the impl for simulator is wrong too now
[2014-10-17 06:52:21] freynaud: they moved the tmp workign folder from application support/sim/ sdk
[2014-10-17 06:52:42] freynaud: still some work to have all the features that worked on xcode5
