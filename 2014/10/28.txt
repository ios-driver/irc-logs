[2014-10-28 12:38:46] grawk1001001: hey all. last time i played around with ios-driver (about a year ago?) I had to downgrade to xcode 4.3. right now i've got Xcode 5.1 and am trying to follow setup instructions on the io page, using the 0.6.6-SNAPSHOT driver.
[2014-10-28 12:39:02] grawk1001001: unable to get the inspector to work with current instructions
[2014-10-28 12:40:35] grawk1001001: steps are: 0. start ios-driver by "java -jar /path/to/ios-standalone-jar" 1. create simple sample app via Xcode dialog, 2. set breakpoint in this app,  launch in debug mode, pause on breakpoint
[2014-10-28 12:43:07] grawk1001001: when i try to access the inspector via http://localhost:5555/inspector/ i see this exception in the stdout of the jar process: Caused by: org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Cannot find session null on the server.
[2014-10-28 12:43:48] grawk1001001: any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks.
[2014-10-28 12:52:29] lukeis: seems like you haven't started a webdriver session yetâ€¦ and the normal path to test against an app is to build it first and then provide ios-driver the path to the '.app' file (for simulator)

[2014-10-28 13:22:47] grawk1001001: Sorry I'm using an IRC web client. I saw someone had replied that I should start up ios-driver and pass in the aut. I did do that as well with the same result.
