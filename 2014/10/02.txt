[2014-10-02 14:34:45] mach6: hi, anyone around? I'm wondering if 'mvn test' is supposed to work from the ios-driver dev branch?  With xcode6 and ios8, I get app crashes
[2014-10-02 14:35:43] lukeis: for mobile safari? yeah, i get app crashes tooâ€¦ startup on mobile safari on ios8 is at about 25% success rate :-/  haven't figured out why yet
[2014-10-02 14:36:29] mach6: k. thanks! yea mobile safari. For native/hybrid apps I get a different error.. something about 2instances should be 1.
[2014-10-02 14:36:40] mach6: I've reached out to my reynaud.. no answer yet. :)
[2014-10-02 14:36:47] mach6: err *mr reynaud
[2014-10-02 14:37:27] lukeis: i think i recently pushed a fix for that
[2014-10-02 14:40:02] mach6: k. is that your change from about 2hrs ago?
[2014-10-02 14:40:05] mach6: on dev
[2014-10-02 14:42:30] lukeis: it was d8d3dcc  that I only pushed up a few hours ago
[2014-10-02 14:42:50] lukeis: (i think)
[2014-10-02 14:45:04] mach6: k. let me try with latest dev branch (including your changes) for native app.
