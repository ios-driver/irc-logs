[2014-04-03 10:15:43] WeissMike: hi
[2014-04-03 10:18:03] WeissMike: Are unminified versions of the atom files available anywhere?
[2014-04-03 10:18:20] lukeis: in the Selenium project
[2014-04-03 10:18:42] lukeis: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/tree/master/javascript/atoms
[2014-04-03 10:19:09] WeissMike: thanks
[2014-04-03 10:22:02] WeissMike: I'm trying to figure out why text inside spans aren't being returned for  ios-driver. Seems to work OK in other drivers.
[2014-04-03 10:22:27] lukeis: the atoms that are in ios-driver are quite old if i remember correctly
[2014-04-03 10:23:31] lukeis: oh, no, looks like fran√ßois updated them recently :)
[2014-04-03 10:24:59] WeissMike: I "beautified" the visible text atom JS file, but it's still pretty ugly!
[2014-04-03 10:25:04] lukeis: https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/tree/dev/server/src/main/resources/atoms
[2014-04-03 10:25:22] lukeis: that's because the generated atoms are from the closure compiler
[2014-04-03 10:25:46] WeissMike: I figured, that's why I;m looking for the "source" of them
[2014-04-03 10:25:53] lukeis: you'll want to get the selenium project and load it in IntelliJ for best debugging purposes :)
[2014-04-03 10:26:34] WeissMike: Yeah, I'm not a Java programmer so I'm trying to avoid that
[2014-04-03 10:26:52] lukeis: if you know javascript, the atoms are only that
[2014-04-03 10:27:23] lukeis: i mention intellij just because we have the project setup for it and it allows you to 'click' through the methods
[2014-04-03 10:29:02] lukeis: WeissMike: here's your entry point for get visible text:  https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/javascript/atoms/dom.js#L1073
[2014-04-03 10:30:29] WeissMike: Great! that helps a lot
