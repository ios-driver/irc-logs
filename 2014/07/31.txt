[2014-07-31 02:26:27] operatiay: Hi, I'm having troubles with starting a test on IOS 7.1.2. not sure whether it's app related or os related. so wanted to ask whether anyone has ever executed tests on 7.1.2?

[2014-07-31 02:36:21] operatiay: :freynaud____ which os version are you testing on?
[2014-07-31 02:36:49] freynaud____: 10.8 xcode 5.1 atm
[2014-07-31 02:37:09] freynaud____: and upgrading to xcode 6 when i've double checked everything
[2014-07-31 02:37:32] freynaud____: i finally managed to launch safari properly on real device, it took me ages
[2014-07-31 02:43:59] operatiay: I've managed to run our previous app version on the 6. now the newer version requires 7. I've got a device with version 7.1.2. unfortunately it's not being recognised as one sufficient for test execution
[2014-07-31 02:44:49] operatiay: it's not the xcode version, I'm speaking about ios version on the device
[2014-07-31 02:45:16] operatiay: could it be a reason for it not to work?
[2014-07-31 02:45:34] freynaud____: 7.1.2 on the device, what xcode do you have ?
[2014-07-31 02:46:25] operatiay: 5.1.1
[2014-07-31 02:47:51] freynaud____: i'll look for a phone with the version to reproduce
[2014-07-31 02:48:05] operatiay: now I've noticed that the previous version was successfully tested on 5.1.1 (so I have no idea whether it would work with 6.x)
[2014-07-31 02:48:20] operatiay: that would be great, thank you
[2014-07-31 02:48:26] freynaud____: real device is more picky I think
[2014-07-31 02:48:41] freynaud____: xcode isn't super backward compatible
[2014-07-31 02:49:17] operatiay: might be... I've already tried to play with some additional capabilities... cap.setCapability(IOSCapabilities.UI_SDK_VERSION, "7.1.2");
[2014-07-31 02:49:33] operatiay: got an error saying org.openqa.selenium.SessionNotCreatedException: Cannot start on version 7.1.2.Installed: [7.1]
