[2013-12-06 11:43:01] nicegraham: hi
[2013-12-06 11:44:36] lukeis: don't talk to nicegraham right now, he is (or should be) 3 pints in by now ;)
[2013-12-06 11:44:42] nicegraham: hah
[2013-12-06 11:44:44] nicegraham: not tonight
[2013-12-06 11:44:51] nicegraham: I'm off to the UK in the morning for rugby
[2013-12-06 11:44:55] nicegraham: so I'm taking it handy
[2013-12-06 11:45:08] lukeis: not sure why ;)
[2013-12-06 11:45:20] nicegraham: cos tomorrow will involve many pints
[2013-12-06 12:04:58] jack090: lolz
[2013-12-06 12:05:29] jack090: Hey you guys might know I've been working with upgrading to the latest IO7
[2013-12-06 12:05:37] nicegraham: eah
[2013-12-06 12:05:50] jack090: I assume I'm going to build from dev branch?
[2013-12-06 12:05:58] nicegraham: nope
[2013-12-06 12:05:59] jack090: release branch doesn't seem to want to run :-)
[2013-12-06 12:06:00] nicegraham: refactor
[2013-12-06 12:06:14] jack090: so no support yet for IOS7
[2013-12-06 12:06:16] jack090: ?
[2013-12-06 12:06:29] nicegraham: there is, on the refactor branch
[2013-12-06 12:06:33] nicegraham: refactor for ios7 :)
[2013-12-06 12:06:36] jack090: ohh
[2013-12-06 12:06:52] nicegraham: It's working good for us
[2013-12-06 12:07:08] jack090: pretty stable?
[2013-12-06 12:07:13] nicegraham: but some unit tests are still failing which is where there hasn't been a proper release
[2013-12-06 12:07:22] nicegraham: as I say, yes for us
[2013-12-06 12:07:28] nicegraham: but some people seem to have struggled
[2013-12-06 12:07:36] lukeis: roman is ironing out some minor kinks in it for us to run ios7 on saucelabs still, but as I understand it, it works ;)
[2013-12-06 12:07:40] nicegraham: but it's hard to know how much of that may be user error
[2013-12-06 12:07:52] jack090: Great
[2013-12-06 12:08:00] nicegraham: ah, so you've been driving that eh lukeis?
[2013-12-06 12:08:00] jack090: I'm mostly using safari web testing
[2013-12-06 12:08:05] nicegraham: I'm liking the commits :)
[2013-12-06 12:08:10] nicegraham: buy that man a beer
[2013-12-06 12:08:25] nicegraham: well, there were some commits improving that today in fact
[2013-12-06 12:08:29] lukeis: nicegraham: i'm not driving anything :) roman's on my team and he's in charge of ios
[2013-12-06 12:08:46] nicegraham: self starter, even better :)
[2013-12-06 12:09:07] lukeis: i got the short stick? why i'm mainly on android now
[2013-12-06 12:09:29] jack090: wait wait wait... Android?
[2013-12-06 12:09:38] nicegraham: as you pointed out - we live in opposite land, I'd like that :)
[2013-12-06 12:09:44] nicegraham: selendroid
[2013-12-06 12:09:51] jack090: ahh
[2013-12-06 12:10:06] nicegraham: our sister project of sorts I guess
[2013-12-06 12:10:15] jack090: yea my emulators keep crashing with the .apk for webdriver
[2013-12-06 12:10:27] lukeis: yeah, use selendroid ;)
[2013-12-06 12:10:51] jack090: does selendroid run chrome or default "browser" for droid?
[2013-12-06 12:11:02] lukeis: although how one uses it to run a "browser" needs to be documented
[2013-12-06 12:11:14] lukeis: selendroid controls an app
[2013-12-06 12:11:19] jack090: correct
[2013-12-06 12:11:21] lukeis: and webviews in that app
[2013-12-06 12:11:33] jack090: I got all the way through getting it setup
[2013-12-06 12:11:43] jack090: but could never get it to open the default browser installed
[2013-12-06 12:11:44] lukeis: if you have a "simple" app that is just a webview (like webdriver.apk) then you can control it with selendroid
[2013-12-06 12:11:54] lukeis: can't open default browser
[2013-12-06 12:12:26] jack090: Specifically I'm looking at testing our web app that is javascript and html5
[2013-12-06 12:12:29] lukeis: how to do this exactly needs to get documented ;)
[2013-12-06 12:12:44] jack090: I don't mind that's it's not the browser as long as it uses the same javascript engine
[2013-12-06 12:13:11] jack090: perhaps I could be a guinea pig then
[2013-12-06 12:13:16] lukeis: it's very close to the same thingâ€¦ just like how MobileSafari and a WebView in iOS are the "same thing"
[2013-12-06 12:13:26] lukeis: (they aren't by the way exactly the same thing)
[2013-12-06 12:13:35] jack090: correct
[2013-12-06 12:13:50] jack090: I'm primarily looking for functionality being the same etc...
[2013-12-06 12:14:06] jack090: does the app load... does it crash.. does it look ok..
[2013-12-06 12:14:17] jack090: do pages render correctly...
[2013-12-06 12:14:24] jack090: webview would probably suffice
[2013-12-06 12:14:38] jack090: Lukeis do you have a link to the webview app example?
[2013-12-06 12:14:53] lukeis: i haven't been able to do a good job at automating the use case of "does it render correctly" in Mobile
[2013-12-06 12:14:54] jack090: If so I could probably write up some directions for the cause
[2013-12-06 12:15:09] lukeis: no, i don'tâ€¦ it needs to get created :)
[2013-12-06 12:15:16] jack090: well i'm processing from a remote webdriver
[2013-12-06 12:15:29] jack090: all the processing is happening remotely
[2013-12-06 12:16:26] jack090: Do you have a simple webview app created? I don't need instructions *yet* I can help write those up
[2013-12-06 12:16:44] gdennis, leaving. (#ios-driver)
[2013-12-06 12:18:45] lukeis: no, i don't have the app created (but it's not hugely difficult to create)
[2013-12-06 12:19:18] nicegraham: lukeis: would a webview in a container be enough?
[2013-12-06 12:19:26] lukeis: yep
[2013-12-06 12:19:52] lukeis: the dumber the app, the easier it will be to automate ;)
[2013-12-06 12:19:56] nicegraham: so no need to implement any hooks for driver.get() or anything
[2013-12-06 12:20:04] nicegraham: the webview handles that
[2013-12-06 12:20:40] lukeis: driver.get() endpoint should be implemented in ios-driver / selendroid (i think it is)
[2013-12-06 12:20:50] nicegraham: yeah it is
[2013-12-06 12:21:25] lukeis: for selendroid all one needs to do once the app is started / connected to is to driver.switchTo().window("WEBVIEW")
[2013-12-06 12:22:00] lukeis: we can / should bundle the sample webview app and implicitly make that call for "AndroidDriver" users
[2013-12-06 12:22:07] lukeis: (on my todo list)
[2013-12-06 12:22:30] nicegraham: looks like you might get a pr from jack090 :)
[2013-12-06 12:22:53] lukeis: so selendroid will eventually bundle the 'simple' webview app and install / use it when requested
[2013-12-06 12:23:05] santiycr, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-12-06 12:23:08] jack090: music to my ears
[2013-12-06 12:23:18] nicegraham: we should probably do the same for ios on real device
[2013-12-06 12:23:22] lukeis: yes
[2013-12-06 12:23:26] lukeis: yes you should ;)
[2013-12-06 12:23:33] jack090: selendroid was what I was planning on
[2013-12-06 12:23:39] jack090: but ran into issues
[2013-12-06 12:23:44] nicegraham: I can get the app made no bother
[2013-12-06 12:24:07] nicegraham: the ios team should be less busy, app gone for final submission today - go live on Tuesday
[2013-12-06 12:24:27] santiycr, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-12-06 12:24:29] lukeis: to build that app in iOS is extremely simple :)
[2013-12-06 12:24:52] nicegraham: i hate xcode
[2013-12-06 12:24:57] nicegraham: *hate*
[2013-12-06 12:25:10] lukeis: if you need me to sign it with my company's distribution profile, I can do that (so it can be installed on any device)
[2013-12-06 12:25:44] nicegraham: would we need to do that if we're bundling it?
[2013-12-06 12:26:04] nicegraham: it would have to be the instruments version
[2013-12-06 12:26:05] lukeis: if you want it to be installed on random user X's real device, yes.
[2013-12-06 12:30:35] jack090: I guess I better go get selendroid installed :-)
[2013-12-06 12:31:09] nicegraham: glad the ios-driver channel could help you reach that conclusion :)
[2013-12-06 12:31:14] lukeis: jack090: next week I should be able to spend some time / document how one can get started
[2013-12-06 12:31:15] lukeis: heh
[2013-12-06 12:31:26] lukeis: jack090: there is a #selendroid channel :)
[2013-12-06 12:31:55] nicegraham: laters lukeis, have a good weekend mate
[2013-12-06 12:32:08] lukeis: thx, you too!
[2013-12-06 12:32:26] lukeis: and of course there's also #selenium  :)
[2013-12-06 12:33:06] jack090: :-D
[2013-12-06 12:33:35] jack090: that's for all help
[2013-12-06 12:33:39] jack090: er.. thanks
