[2013-12-12 07:22:40] jack090: but I ended up using sudo and (it didn't work) then went back without sudo and it worked

[2013-12-12 08:20:26] nicegraham: jack090: kinda
[2013-12-12 08:27:43] jack090: ever had safari crash in IOS 7 on startup
[2013-12-12 08:28:07] jack090: I can load xcode then the simulator
[2013-12-12 08:28:13] jack090: and IO 6 works fine
[2013-12-12 08:28:18] jack090: but IOS 7 won't even load
[2013-12-12 08:28:35] jack090: well the OS loads but safari crashes immediately on startup
[2013-12-12 08:28:44] jack090: i've deleted xcode and reinstalled it
[2013-12-12 08:29:02] jack090: (Btw I got it working on a different machine and this is the other pc i'm trying to get working
[2013-12-12 08:29:20] rsalvador, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-12-12 08:29:25] nicegraham: so it's config on this new machine?
[2013-12-12 08:31:34] jack090: This is a new PC that I'm trying to get working
[2013-12-12 08:31:51] jack090: the other one we worked with yesterday is up and running
[2013-12-12 08:33:29] nicegraham: I don't know
[2013-12-12 08:33:40] nicegraham: make sure all the permissions are ok
[2013-12-12 08:33:49] nicegraham: that you can launch it manually
[2013-12-12 08:33:55] nicegraham: etc etc
[2013-12-12 08:35:05] jack090: yea I can't launch it manually
[2013-12-12 08:35:07] jack090: it just crashes
[2013-12-12 08:35:16] jack090: when ios-driver launches it's not even there
[2013-12-12 08:35:49] nicegraham: i haven't seen that
[2013-12-12 08:37:11] jack090: I guess I'll just let this machine run 6.1
[2013-12-12 08:37:13] jack090: :-)
[2013-12-12 08:37:26] jack090: I don't have the energy to fight it today :-)
[2013-12-12 08:37:47] jack090: I do have this stuff written down in my company wiki
[2013-12-12 08:37:57] nicegraham: make sure if you are using ios7 that you're on 5.0.2 or whatever the latest xcode is
[2013-12-12 08:38:12] nicegraham: cool, maybe update our wiki too? :)
[2013-12-12 08:38:19] lukeis, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-12-12 08:38:26] nicegraham: you could create an ios7 section or add to the faw
[2013-12-12 08:38:28] nicegraham: faq
[2013-12-12 08:38:51] jack090: I approached it from someone who doesn't know anything
[2013-12-12 08:38:58] jack090: screenshots etc..
[2013-12-12 08:39:07] nicegraham: sounds very nice! :)
[2013-12-12 08:39:37] nicegraham: the docs are on the gh-pages branch
[2013-12-12 08:39:47] jack090: It's ok :-) I more or less have people working in our company who have never used a mac or linux
[2013-12-12 08:39:48] nicegraham: so a pull request thre would be awesome
[2013-12-12 08:40:23] jack090: where's the ios-driver wiki?
[2013-12-12 08:40:59] nicegraham: on the gh-pages branch
[2013-12-12 08:41:29] nicegraham: https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/tree/gh-pages
[2013-12-12 08:42:11] nicegraham: the wiki itself is here
[2013-12-12 08:42:12] nicegraham: http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/
[2013-12-12 08:42:24] nicegraham: once you update that branch the content updates
[2013-12-12 08:42:43] jack090: sorry I was looking for actually wiki I had my "blonde" moment
[2013-12-12 08:42:49] jack090: er.. actual wiki
[2013-12-12 08:43:34] jack090: new to the world of git :-) I'm use to jira/visual studio
[2013-12-12 08:43:58] nicegraham: we use jira/stash too
[2013-12-12 08:44:03] nicegraham: but intellij and java
[2013-12-12 08:44:06] jack090: bear with me
[2013-12-12 08:44:09] jack090: :-)
[2013-12-12 08:44:25] jack090: I'm going to take a whirl so be prepare for newb questions
[2013-12-12 08:44:59] nicegraham: click the fork button on our repo
[2013-12-12 08:45:09] nicegraham: then git checkout your repo
[2013-12-12 08:45:16] nicegraham: git checkout gh-pages
[2013-12-12 08:45:25] nicegraham: you will then have our wiki locally
[2013-12-12 08:45:29] jack090: yea I have a fork created
[2013-12-12 08:45:37] nicegraham: you should be able to open the files in your browser
[2013-12-12 08:45:38] jack090: using the github app
[2013-12-12 08:45:44] nicegraham: add/make changes
[2013-12-12 08:45:49] nicegraham: and git add .
[2013-12-12 08:45:54] nicegraham: git commit
[2013-12-12 08:45:58] nicegraham: git push
[2013-12-12 08:46:07] nicegraham: then back in github make the pull request
[2013-12-12 08:47:54] jack090: do you want this content in the FAQ section?
[2013-12-12 08:48:47] nicegraham: wherever you think it fits
[2013-12-12 08:49:00] nicegraham: the installation guide could probably be updated
[2013-12-12 08:49:00] jack090: Well I have two things documented
[2013-12-12 08:49:22] jack090: the first is running standard release version
[2013-12-12 08:49:25] nicegraham: or mavericks/ios7 specifics added
[2013-12-12 08:50:16] jack090: the 2nd is how-to-guide to get the refactor branch and then getting up and running. (also have to set language to "en" if using C#)
[2013-12-12 08:50:37] jack090: not sure how helpful that documentation will be once refactor is released
[2013-12-12 08:51:08] nicegraham: it could be a general build from github document
[2013-12-12 08:51:18] nicegraham: not everyone knows how to do it
[2013-12-12 08:51:22] nicegraham: maven etc
[2013-12-12 08:51:38] jack090: right. I even have the download/setup of maven
[2013-12-12 08:51:46] jack090: it might be helpful
[2013-12-12 08:51:52] nicegraham: all good stuff for others
[2013-12-12 08:52:06] jack090: I'll make a new tab then?
[2013-12-12 08:52:20] nicegraham: yeah, why not :)
[2013-12-12 08:52:58] jack090: something titled "Building Latest Branch" ??
[2013-12-12 08:53:22] jack090: Need help on the tab title
[2013-12-12 08:54:16] nicegraham: yeah, or build it yourself
[2013-12-12 08:54:44] jack090: ok I'm going with Build It Yourself
[2013-12-12 08:58:57] lukeis: nicegraham: i really hate issue trackers used for non-issues
[2013-12-12 08:59:17] lukeis: #177 for example ;)
[2013-12-12 08:59:19] nicegraham: i see that :)
[2013-12-12 09:00:16] lukeis: the selenium project closes on average 5 a week ;)
[2013-12-12 09:00:42] lukeis: (of the non-issues bug reports just looking for 'help')
[2013-12-12 09:05:37] jack090: I bet if we opened a Forum it'd be slammed with help requests :-)
[2013-12-12 09:05:45] jack090: we'll make lukeis moderate it :-)
[2013-12-12 09:05:58] lukeis: we have a forum
[2013-12-12 09:06:10] lukeis: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ios-driver
[2013-12-12 09:06:11] jack090: google groups?
[2013-12-12 09:06:16] lukeis: and it's not slammed ;)
[2013-12-12 09:06:31] jack090: meh much harder to use than an old fashioned bb
[2013-12-12 09:06:36] lukeis: well, not in comparison to the Selenium project's groupâ€¦ which i do moderate ;)
[2013-12-12 09:06:40] jack090: I hate the changes google added
[2013-12-12 09:06:54] jack090: I'm old school
[2013-12-12 09:06:56] nicegraham: it's the definition of un-slammed
[2013-12-12 09:07:22] jack090: Is it on the main ios-driver page?
[2013-12-12 09:07:27] jack090: I never knew about it lol

[2013-12-12 11:20:54] nicegraham: :cls
[2013-12-12 11:20:58] nicegraham: :cla
[2013-12-12 11:21:50] lukeis: umm, for selenium anything 'complex' to the docs (basically more than a typo or punctuation) simon likes to have it
[2013-12-12 11:22:12] lukeis: as for other projectsâ€¦ i've never seen that ;)
[2013-12-12 11:22:33] nicegraham: since I can't remember where it is, let's risk it ;)
[2013-12-12 11:22:53] lukeis: code is codeâ€¦ docs are docs. don't know why docs need a cla

[2013-12-12 11:38:49] jack090: argh
[2013-12-12 11:39:12] jack090: so I made a new tab in the javascript/properties.js
[2013-12-12 11:39:24] jack090: the problem is it looks fine on a PC
[2013-12-12 11:39:29] jack090: but on the mac it's wrapping
[2013-12-12 11:39:30] jack090: :-(
[2013-12-12 11:40:26] Phasze: jack090: you got grid ios-driver working with grid with ios7 right?
[2013-12-12 11:40:46] jack090: yes on one machine
[2013-12-12 11:40:46] jack090: :-)
[2013-12-12 11:40:59] Phasze: which branch/download?
[2013-12-12 11:41:04] jack090: refactor
[2013-12-12 11:41:14] jack090: and I have the documentation too
[2013-12-12 11:41:15] jack090: :-)
[2013-12-12 11:41:25] Phasze: documentation?
[2013-12-12 11:41:45] jack090: but the styling of the ios-driver html pages has my new tab wrapping in all the wrong places
[2013-12-12 11:41:54] Phasze: oh lol
[2013-12-12 11:41:58] jack090: Yea I wrote up a how-to guide for building from scratch
[2013-12-12 11:42:10] Phasze: so I can get it to connect to grid, but when I try and run a test it throws an exception :(
[2013-12-12 11:42:18] jack090: Looks good on my windows pc but looks awful on the mac
[2013-12-12 11:42:36] jack090: I never had luck out of selenium grid
[2013-12-12 11:42:43] jack090: I have a hub running
[2013-12-12 11:42:52] jack090: but I wrote a framework that does load balancing etc...
[2013-12-12 11:43:04] jack090: I have my own "grid" so to speak
[2013-12-12 11:43:24] Phasze: yeah I kind of did that
[2013-12-12 11:43:29] Phasze: but still use grid as the main framework
[2013-12-12 11:43:44] jack090: each node is essentially connected to the hub but I call the nodes directly without the hub
[2013-12-12 11:43:49] jack090: right
[2013-12-12 11:44:27] Phasze: do you include -simulators when you start up?
[2013-12-12 11:45:35] nicegraham: jack090: I'll look at it when you create the pull request
[2013-12-12 11:46:13] jack090: yes
[2013-12-12 11:46:19] jack090: ok I'll check it in as-is
[2013-12-12 11:46:51] jack090: nicegraham you can probably just increase the width of the "master" frame (if you know what I mean) and it'll look fine
[2013-12-12 11:47:00] jack090: like an additional 50 pixels might do it
[2013-12-12 11:48:19] Phasze: how do you get the "iPad" one of the simulators to use your app instead of safari?
[2013-12-12 11:48:50] jack090: instead of iphone you mean?
[2013-12-12 11:49:11] Phasze: I'm just trying to get a test running at all lol
[2013-12-12 11:50:01] Phasze: specifically the InternationalMountains test
[2013-12-12 11:50:26] jack090: oh you could probably use my guide
[2013-12-12 11:50:28] jack090: when you build
[2013-12-12 11:50:34] jack090: you could probably comment out the other tests
[2013-12-12 11:50:36] jack090: and let maven do it
[2013-12-12 11:51:01] Phasze: link me your guide
[2013-12-12 11:51:09] jack090: I think I checked it in
[2013-12-12 11:51:14] jack090: nicegraham can you see it?
[2013-12-12 11:51:36] nicegraham: you may have checked it in to your repo
[2013-12-12 11:51:43] nicegraham: you now need to make a pull request back to us
[2013-12-12 11:51:57] nicegraham: if you open it in github you should see a pull request button
[2013-12-12 11:53:06] jack090: hrm.. I can't see the change in gitHub though
[2013-12-12 11:53:11] jack090: I added a new html file
