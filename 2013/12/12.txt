[2013-12-12 07:22:15] jack090: it didn't make sense how I did it
[2013-12-12 07:22:40] jack090: but I ended up using sudo and (it didn't work) then went back without sudo and it worked

[2013-12-12 08:27:43] jack090: ever had safari crash in IOS 7 on startup
[2013-12-12 08:28:07] jack090: I can load xcode then the simulator
[2013-12-12 08:28:13] jack090: and IO 6 works fine
[2013-12-12 08:28:18] jack090: but IOS 7 won't even load
[2013-12-12 08:28:35] jack090: well the OS loads but safari crashes immediately on startup
[2013-12-12 08:28:44] jack090: i've deleted xcode and reinstalled it
[2013-12-12 08:29:02] jack090: (Btw I got it working on a different machine and this is the other pc i'm trying to get working

[2013-12-12 08:29:25] nicegraham: so it's config on this new machine?
[2013-12-12 08:31:34] jack090: This is a new PC that I'm trying to get working
[2013-12-12 08:31:51] jack090: the other one we worked with yesterday is up and running
[2013-12-12 08:33:29] nicegraham: I don't know
[2013-12-12 08:33:40] nicegraham: make sure all the permissions are ok
[2013-12-12 08:33:49] nicegraham: that you can launch it manually
[2013-12-12 08:33:55] nicegraham: etc etc
[2013-12-12 08:35:05] jack090: yea I can't launch it manually
[2013-12-12 08:35:07] jack090: it just crashes
[2013-12-12 08:35:16] jack090: when ios-driver launches it's not even there
[2013-12-12 08:35:49] nicegraham: i haven't seen that
[2013-12-12 08:37:11] jack090: I guess I'll just let this machine run 6.1
[2013-12-12 08:37:13] jack090: :-)
[2013-12-12 08:37:26] jack090: I don't have the energy to fight it today :-)
[2013-12-12 08:37:47] jack090: I do have this stuff written down in my company wiki
[2013-12-12 08:37:57] nicegraham: make sure if you are using ios7 that you're on 5.0.2 or whatever the latest xcode is
[2013-12-12 08:38:12] nicegraham: cool, maybe update our wiki too? :)
[2013-12-12 08:38:19] lukeis, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-12-12 08:38:26] nicegraham: you could create an ios7 section or add to the faw
[2013-12-12 08:38:28] nicegraham: faq
[2013-12-12 08:38:51] jack090: I approached it from someone who doesn't know anything
[2013-12-12 08:38:58] jack090: screenshots etc..
[2013-12-12 08:39:07] nicegraham: sounds very nice! :)
[2013-12-12 08:39:37] nicegraham: the docs are on the gh-pages branch
[2013-12-12 08:39:47] jack090: It's ok :-) I more or less have people working in our company who have never used a mac or linux
[2013-12-12 08:39:48] nicegraham: so a pull request thre would be awesome
