[2013-12-04 11:19:16] gdennis1: before I give it a whirl myself, what is the current state of real device support from ios-driver? stable? known to not be working? a little buggy?
[2013-12-04 11:21:47] gdennis, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-12-04 11:22:02] nicegraham: gdennis1: it's broken
[2013-12-04 11:22:30] nicegraham: the licencing thing has been ongoing
[2013-12-04 11:22:47] nicegraham: I think at this point we are focusing efforts on simulators
[2013-12-04 11:24:11] gdennis: do you have any details/specifics on the licensing issues? Is it access to the instruments code?
[2013-12-04 11:24:29] gdennis: we're curious :)

[2013-12-04 11:25:19] nicegraham: no, instruments is grand
[2013-12-04 11:25:48] nicegraham: we were using libimbobiledevice because it was more robust and provided more control of the devices
[2013-12-04 11:26:12] nicegraham: I think the owner of that that library is trying to commercialize at least part of it
[2013-12-04 11:26:24] nicegraham: so it's a bit up in the air
[2013-12-04 11:26:56] nicegraham: I think we're going to continue to provide support for it but it will be up to individuals to get a licence agreement for libimobiledevice
[2013-12-04 11:27:13] nicegraham: and I have no idea on costs for that I'm afraid
[2013-12-04 11:27:21] gdennis: isn't current libimobiledevice LGPL?
[2013-12-04 11:27:32] nicegraham: that's the last I heard at least, freynaud could comment further
[2013-12-04 11:27:37] nicegraham: parts of it are
[2013-12-04 11:27:56] nicegraham: there was work to add more functionality to aid ios-driver
[2013-12-04 11:28:03] nicegraham: and I think that's where the problem is
[2013-12-04 11:28:15] nicegraham: those changes aren't public
[2013-12-04 11:29:25] gdennis: any idea what those changes enable specifically? and whether it comes into play if there is only a need to drive Safari?
[2013-12-04 11:29:51] nicegraham: no, afaik it still won't enable safari
[2013-12-04 11:34:49] gdennis: if I want details on what specifically needs to be completed, would freynaud know or do I need to talk to the limd devs?
