[2013-12-17 07:12:05] smohanat: can someone point me to how to set the desiredCapabilities for a retina iPhone device simulator
[2013-12-17 07:35:57] nirvdrum: Set the device to "Retina4"
[2013-12-17 07:36:13] nirvdrum: Or "Retina35" if you want to target the 4S.
[2013-12-17 07:38:38] smohanat: thx
[2013-12-17 07:39:24] smohanat: DesiredCapabilities safariIphone = IOSCapabilities.iphone("Safari");
[2013-12-17 07:39:25] smohanat: 		safariIphone.setCapability(IOSCapabilities.SIMULATOR, true);
[2013-12-17 07:39:26] smohanat: 		safariIphone.setCapability(IOSCapabilities.DEVICE, "Retina4");
[2013-12-17 07:39:34] nirvdrum: They're the names you see in the device selection menu in the simulator.
[2013-12-17 07:39:52] smohanat: what i have pated above looks ok?
[2013-12-17 07:40:35] nirvdrum: I believe the attribute is called Variation.
[2013-12-17 07:40:49] nirvdrum: But I don't use the Java bindings.  So I don't know if that maps correctly internally.
[2013-12-17 07:41:03] smohanat: k thx
[2013-12-17 07:41:19] smohanat: Let me give this a try,
[2013-12-17 07:41:45] smohanat: is there any specie files/folders i need to delete after moving to the new refactor branch ios-server driver
[2013-12-17 07:42:01] smohanat: someone was mentioning a corrupted plist file can cause issues
[2013-12-17 07:42:36] nirvdrum: I haven't tried the branch out, so I can't say.
[2013-12-17 07:42:45] nirvdrum: nicegraham or lukeis would be people to ask.
[2013-12-17 07:43:56] smohanat: thx
[2013-12-17 07:45:51] smohanat: org.openqa.selenium.SessionNotCreatedException: not a matching DeviceType string: Retina4
[2013-12-17 07:49:51] nirvdrum: Try changing the variation instead?

[2013-12-17 11:35:06] jlipps: hola lukeis
[2013-12-17 11:35:29] jlipps: i'm wondering how you guys have been dealing with ios7 instruments flakiness in ios-driver land
[2013-12-17 11:36:15] jlipps: are you using the built-in instruments or have you transitioned everything to libimobiledevice's instruments?
[2013-12-17 11:36:30] lukeis: hiâ€¦ i have no idea :)
[2013-12-17 11:36:38] *lukeis codes his selendroid more ;)'
[2013-12-17 11:36:44] jlipps: useless!
[2013-12-17 11:36:46] jlipps: ok :-)
[2013-12-17 11:36:49] lukeis: rsalvador might help there
[2013-12-17 11:37:07] jlipps: ohai rsalvador
[2013-12-17 11:37:08] lukeis: he's away from keyboard at the moment though
[2013-12-17 11:37:14] *lukeis can see him'
[2013-12-17 11:37:56] nicegraham: jlipps: we're suffering too
[2013-12-17 11:38:20] nicegraham: we haven't moved to libimolbile and that's unlikely right now due to licensing
[2013-12-17 11:38:26] jlipps: hmm that's too bad
[2013-12-17 11:38:36] jlipps: oh really what is their license
[2013-12-17 11:38:38] nicegraham: yep *sadface*
[2013-12-17 11:38:46] nicegraham: commercial
[2013-12-17 11:38:51] nicegraham: well for the new stuff it is
[2013-12-17 11:38:56] jlipps: oh no way
[2013-12-17 11:39:03] nicegraham: yeah
[2013-12-17 11:39:43] jlipps: on github they still show a GPL
[2013-12-17 11:39:54] nicegraham: for parts of it, it is
[2013-12-17 11:40:15] nicegraham: but freynaud was working on a lot of new stuff with martin and that can't be oss'd
[2013-12-17 11:43:00] Phasze: http://pastebin.com/GMQRAbrU  any ideas?  Just starts up, launches the app, and shuts down :(
[2013-12-17 11:44:15] rsalvador: jlipps: for iOS 7 we have been running only on simulators, no devices
[2013-12-17 11:44:54] jlipps: rsalvador:  yes, but even with simulators i'm seeing instruments totally fail in a variety of situations
[2013-12-17 11:45:31] rsalvador: it is working ok now at least for our tests, had to do quite a few changes to ios-driver though, all changes are in the "refactor" branch
[2013-12-17 11:46:05] nicegraham: we're still seeing random crashes when running on grid
[2013-12-17 11:46:12] nicegraham: it's not so bad running locally

[2013-12-17 11:50:11] jlipps: rsalvador:  yeah seems to be related somehow to system resources. on my own system i get one flake in 10. on our sauce vms it seems more like 1 in 3
[2013-12-17 11:50:37] jlipps: we mitigate that by requeueing vms if it flakes, so it doesn't affect our users test results so much
[2013-12-17 11:50:41] jlipps: but it's driving me crazy :-)
[2013-12-17 11:50:53] nicegraham: jlipps: we've seen the same - we've dropped the number of vms per physical machine
[2013-12-17 11:50:59] nicegraham: we're down to one now :(
[2013-12-17 11:51:02] rsalvador: the optimization in the refactor branch from this morning seems to have fixed the flakiness on sauce vms
[2013-12-17 11:51:13] Phasze: nicegraham: random crashes?  Like what I just saw?
[2013-12-17 11:51:24] Phasze: any errors given?
[2013-12-17 11:51:41] nicegraham: safari crashes on launch
[2013-12-17 11:51:44] nicegraham: that type of thing
[2013-12-17 11:52:04] nicegraham: our native apps seem less affected
[2013-12-17 11:52:07] jlipps: rsalvador:  what kinds of optimization are we talking about? how is refactoring ios-driver code possibly related to instruments flakiness?
[2013-12-17 11:52:13] Phasze: hmm
[2013-12-17 11:52:49] jlipps: btw, can ios-driver launch safari on ios7? we haven't been able to using the built-in instruments so far. at least not the same way we were with ios6
[2013-12-17 11:53:00] nicegraham: yeah
[2013-12-17 11:53:19] nicegraham: I think rsalvador fixed that
[2013-12-17 11:54:10] rsalvador: cpu/memory optimization, I guess that stress less the VMs and makes it less likelly to crash
[2013-12-17 11:55:27] rsalvador: jlipps: ios-driver can launch safari on iOS 7, see: https://saucelabs.com/tests/dbc10fcc9bf84838a95f7d64cc754b29
[2013-12-17 11:57:17] jlipps: rsalvador:  nice! how did you get around the "cannot install app" issue?
[2013-12-17 11:58:52] rsalvador: had to move the safari app out of the installation dir: https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/commit/05a37fb04ffae236af1843affaa2546ef6cc6ada
[2013-12-17 11:59:08] rsalvador: there where other changes later on, see the commits in the "refactor" branch
[2013-12-17 12:03:12] Phasze: Ah, eventually I get a popup that says, "Simulator session timed out."
[2013-12-17 12:07:07] jlipps: rsalvador:  interesting. we do copy the app out of the path, but still doesn't work for us
[2013-12-17 12:08:04] rsalvador: do you use instruments?, if so you can try running the resulting instruments command and see why it fails in one case and not in the other
[2013-12-17 12:08:42] rsalvador: if you run the instruments command that ios-driver executes you'll see it works if safari.app is moved out and doesn't work if it is not moved out
