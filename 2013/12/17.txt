[2013-12-17 06:27:52] smohanat: anyone knows what this error means  "org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: iPhone incompatible with SDK 7.0"
[2013-12-17 06:28:12] smohanat: I am using the driver built from the refactor branch
[2013-12-17 07:12:05] smohanat: can someone point me to how to set the desiredCapabilities for a retina iPhone device simulator
[2013-12-17 07:35:57] nirvdrum: Set the device to "Retina4"
[2013-12-17 07:36:13] nirvdrum: Or "Retina35" if you want to target the 4S.
[2013-12-17 07:38:38] smohanat: thx
[2013-12-17 07:39:24] smohanat: DesiredCapabilities safariIphone = IOSCapabilities.iphone("Safari");
[2013-12-17 07:39:25] smohanat: 		safariIphone.setCapability(IOSCapabilities.SIMULATOR, true);
[2013-12-17 07:39:26] smohanat: 		safariIphone.setCapability(IOSCapabilities.DEVICE, "Retina4");
[2013-12-17 07:39:34] nirvdrum: They're the names you see in the device selection menu in the simulator.
[2013-12-17 07:39:52] smohanat: what i have pated above looks ok?
[2013-12-17 07:40:35] nirvdrum: I believe the attribute is called Variation.
[2013-12-17 07:40:49] nirvdrum: But I don't use the Java bindings.  So I don't know if that maps correctly internally.
[2013-12-17 07:41:03] smohanat: k thx
[2013-12-17 07:41:19] smohanat: Let me give this a try,
[2013-12-17 07:41:45] smohanat: is there any specie files/folders i need to delete after moving to the new refactor branch ios-server driver
[2013-12-17 07:42:01] smohanat: someone was mentioning a corrupted plist file can cause issues
[2013-12-17 07:42:36] nirvdrum: I haven't tried the branch out, so I can't say.
[2013-12-17 07:42:45] nirvdrum: nicegraham or lukeis would be people to ask.
[2013-12-17 07:43:56] smohanat: thx
[2013-12-17 07:45:51] smohanat: org.openqa.selenium.SessionNotCreatedException: not a matching DeviceType string: Retina4
[2013-12-17 07:49:51] nirvdrum: Try changing the variation instead?
[2013-12-17 07:54:57] smohanat: variation?

[2013-12-17 08:21:19] nicegraham: and you should be setting the variation to one of those
[2013-12-17 08:21:28] smohanat: thx
[2013-12-17 08:21:37] nicegraham: safariIphone.setCapability("variation", "Retina4");
