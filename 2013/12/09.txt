[2013-12-09 09:41:59] gdennis: nicegraham: yes, -simulators did the trick
[2013-12-09 09:42:14] nicegraham: cool
[2013-12-09 09:42:27] gdennis: nicegraham: should that be part of the setup instructions now?
[2013-12-09 09:42:36] gdennis: or was I missing something else that should have enabled that by default?
[2013-12-09 09:43:06] nicegraham: it should be in the setup instructions
[2013-12-09 09:43:13] nicegraham: they haven't been updated in a while
[2013-12-09 09:43:22] nicegraham: the console tells you when it's not enabled though
[2013-12-09 09:43:31] nicegraham: maybe that message could be clearer too
[2013-12-09 09:43:45] nicegraham: as in "you won't have access to the simulator without this"
[2013-12-09 09:44:06] nicegraham: or we switch the default behaviour to being on
[2013-12-09 09:44:13] nicegraham: which we probably should :)

[2013-12-09 10:22:22] nicegraham: when all the unit tests pass
[2013-12-09 10:22:30] nicegraham: freynaud has been working on that

[2013-12-09 10:26:56] jack090_: do we have eta on that?

[2013-12-09 11:41:33] nicegraham: what's the story with the java 6 branch do you know?
[2013-12-09 11:41:35] nicegraham: I did
[2013-12-09 11:41:43] nicegraham: they had DOUBLE Pints at the game
[2013-12-09 11:42:02] lukeis: oh, saucelabs doesn't have java 7 installedâ€¦ so we keep needing to build it for java6 to install there

[2013-12-09 11:42:56] nicegraham: not the best photo to be fair
[2013-12-09 11:42:57] lukeis: they willâ€¦ eventually...

[2013-12-09 12:08:48] gdennis: another noob question, sorry
[2013-12-09 12:09:01] gdennis: trying to run a simple webdriver test against the simulator
[2013-12-09 12:09:27] gdennis: I get this error from ios-server: WARNING DefaultCommandListener.stderr  2013-12-09 15:04:48.466 instruments[13260:507] -[__NSCFConstantString isEqualToNumber:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x7fff784addb0
[2013-12-09 12:10:42] nicegraham: what language?
[2013-12-09 12:10:46] gdennis: java
[2013-12-09 12:11:20] nicegraham: I don't know really
[2013-12-09 12:11:30] nicegraham: at what point do you get that?
[2013-12-09 12:12:25] gdennis: creating a new RemoteWebDriver
[2013-12-09 12:12:44] nicegraham: ok, what do you capabilities look like?
[2013-12-09 12:13:10] gdennis: DesiredCapabilities safari = IOSCapabilities.iphone("Safari");
[2013-12-09 12:13:12] gdennis: safari.setCapability(IOSCapabilities.SIMULATOR, true);

[2013-12-09 12:14:20] gdennis: no, this is my first attempt
[2013-12-09 12:14:36] nicegraham: I have a feeling this is something to do with ios7
[2013-12-09 12:14:40] nicegraham: but I'm not sure what
[2013-12-09 12:14:47] nicegraham: I'm pretty sure someone else has posted something similar
[2013-12-09 12:15:20] nicegraham: https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/issues/174
[2013-12-09 12:16:56] gdennis: ok, also preceding noob question, should I be expected to start the simulator in advance of running the test?
[2013-12-09 12:17:25] gdennis: i've been starting it Xcode > Open Developer Tool > IOS Simulator
[2013-12-09 12:17:54] nicegraham: no, it shouldn't be running
[2013-12-09 12:18:21] gdennis: do I need XCode at least open?
[2013-12-09 12:18:44] nicegraham: nope
[2013-12-09 12:19:15] gdennis: ok, these were things I was just trying because of the earlier error, good to know they are not necessary
[2013-12-09 12:21:48] gdennis: nicegraham: and can I change the iOS version chosen using the DesiredCaps?
[2013-12-09 12:21:56] nicegraham: you can
[2013-12-09 12:22:06] nicegraham: but you need to ahve the exiled sdk folder created
[2013-12-09 12:22:11] nicegraham: and the permissions set
[2013-12-09 12:22:20] nicegraham: and of course the sdks available
[2013-12-09 12:24:56] gdennis: and if I have all those, is the capability I'm looking for UI_VERSION or something else?
[2013-12-09 12:28:12] nicegraham: er, no I think it's sdk version or something
[2013-12-09 12:28:32] gdennis: ok, there is UI_SDK_VERSION
[2013-12-09 12:28:37] nicegraham: there should be a constant for it in IOSCapabilities.SDK something something
[2013-12-09 12:29:05] gdennis: yeah, UI_SDK_VERSION is the string "sdkVersion"
[2013-12-09 12:29:12] gdennis: thanks
[2013-12-09 12:29:57] nicegraham: I don't know why there's a UI there...
[2013-12-09 12:31:22] nicegraham: yeha, that looks like it
[2013-12-09 12:31:29] gdennis: oh, there's a getSdkVersion and setSdkVersion convenience method for it, too
