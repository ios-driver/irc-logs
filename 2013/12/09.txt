[2013-12-09 08:35:40] gdennis: running through the ios-driver setup instructions: why would my application under test not appear in the list of supported apps in the webdriver /status response?

[2013-12-09 09:16:11] nicegraham: gdennis: have to set the -simulators flag on startup?
[2013-12-09 09:16:41] nicegraham: is it either specifically named using -aut or in the folder ios-driver is monitoring?

[2013-12-09 09:41:59] gdennis: nicegraham: yes, -simulators did the trick
[2013-12-09 09:42:14] nicegraham: cool
[2013-12-09 09:42:27] gdennis: nicegraham: should that be part of the setup instructions now?
[2013-12-09 09:42:36] gdennis: or was I missing something else that should have enabled that by default?
[2013-12-09 09:43:06] nicegraham: it should be in the setup instructions
[2013-12-09 09:43:13] nicegraham: they haven't been updated in a while
[2013-12-09 09:43:22] nicegraham: the console tells you when it's not enabled though
[2013-12-09 09:43:31] nicegraham: maybe that message could be clearer too
[2013-12-09 09:43:45] nicegraham: as in "you won't have access to the simulator without this"
[2013-12-09 09:44:06] nicegraham: or we switch the default behaviour to being on
[2013-12-09 09:44:13] nicegraham: which we probably should :)
