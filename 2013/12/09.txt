[2013-12-09 09:16:41] nicegraham: is it either specifically named using -aut or in the folder ios-driver is monitoring?

[2013-12-09 09:41:59] gdennis: nicegraham: yes, -simulators did the trick
[2013-12-09 09:42:14] nicegraham: cool
[2013-12-09 09:42:27] gdennis: nicegraham: should that be part of the setup instructions now?
[2013-12-09 09:42:36] gdennis: or was I missing something else that should have enabled that by default?
[2013-12-09 09:43:06] nicegraham: it should be in the setup instructions
[2013-12-09 09:43:13] nicegraham: they haven't been updated in a while
[2013-12-09 09:43:22] nicegraham: the console tells you when it's not enabled though
[2013-12-09 09:43:31] nicegraham: maybe that message could be clearer too
[2013-12-09 09:43:45] nicegraham: as in "you won't have access to the simulator without this"
[2013-12-09 09:44:06] nicegraham: or we switch the default behaviour to being on
[2013-12-09 09:44:13] nicegraham: which we probably should :)

[2013-12-09 10:22:17] nicegraham: soon
[2013-12-09 10:22:22] nicegraham: when all the unit tests pass
[2013-12-09 10:22:30] nicegraham: freynaud has been working on that
[2013-12-09 10:26:47] jack090_: ahh
[2013-12-09 10:26:56] jack090_: do we have eta on that?
[2013-12-09 10:27:01] jack090_: like maybe a week or two
[2013-12-09 10:27:03] nicegraham: nope
[2013-12-09 10:27:08] jack090_: or a month +?
[2013-12-09 10:27:17] nicegraham: feel free to contribute some fixes to speed it up :)
[2013-12-09 10:27:42] jack090_: :-D I actually might
[2013-12-09 10:27:57] jack090_: lukeis got me started on selendroid though

[2013-12-09 11:41:35] nicegraham: I did
[2013-12-09 11:41:43] nicegraham: they had DOUBLE Pints at the game
[2013-12-09 11:42:02] lukeis: oh, saucelabs doesn't have java 7 installedâ€¦ so we keep needing to build it for java6 to install there

[2013-12-09 11:43:01] nicegraham: but the pints!
[2013-12-09 11:43:06] lukeis: heh :)
