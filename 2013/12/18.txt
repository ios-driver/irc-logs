[2013-12-18 08:44:08] Phasze: sup jack090
[2013-12-18 08:44:37] jack090: not much just playing configuration manager at my job today :-(
[2013-12-18 08:44:52] jack090: I hate slapping developers around
[2013-12-18 08:45:10] Phasze: lol, I just wish this bloody InternationalMountains app would work on grid....
[2013-12-18 08:45:29] jack090: where's it blowing up at?
[2013-12-18 08:46:00] Phasze: on launch
[2013-12-18 08:46:12] Phasze: it starts up the IOS Simulator, starts the app, closes the app, then closes the simulator
[2013-12-18 08:46:28] Phasze: and eventually my "new RemoteWebDriver()" call times out
[2013-12-18 08:49:32] jack090: ohh yea
[2013-12-18 08:49:48] jack090: I could never get the test "apps" when you build with maven to work
[2013-12-18 08:50:02] jack090: I had to do -DskipTests
[2013-12-18 08:50:05] Phasze: built with xcode
[2013-12-18 08:50:26] jack090: can you manually open the app?
[2013-12-18 08:50:37] Phasze: yup
[2013-12-18 08:50:45] jack090: I would file a bug phasze
[2013-12-18 08:50:57] jack090: I think someone was working on getting the "tests" when building to pass
[2013-12-18 08:51:00] Phasze: if I could find anyone else who has even tried this......
[2013-12-18 08:51:23] Phasze: it's just the bloody InternationalMountains test app
[2013-12-18 08:51:32] jack090: I can get safari to work
[2013-12-18 08:51:37] jack090: but haven't tried any apps
[2013-12-18 08:51:55] Phasze: and apparently neither has anybody else who frequents this room :P
[2013-12-18 08:52:14] Phasze: I keep hoping lukeis will have the answer some day for me ;)
[2013-12-18 08:52:39] jack090: you could always use 6.1
[2013-12-18 08:52:42] jack090: for the time being :-)
[2013-12-18 08:52:44] lukeis: heh, you know i don't do iOS stuff anymore right? :-D  (I work on android full time basically)
[2013-12-18 08:52:59] Phasze: that won't stop me from hoping!
[2013-12-18 08:53:28] jack090: lukeis has to save his patience for me when I spam him for help on android
[2013-12-18 08:53:31] Phasze: lukeis: what are you using for android automation anyway, appium?
[2013-12-18 08:53:52] lukeis: no ;)
[2013-12-18 08:53:54] lukeis: selendroid
[2013-12-18 08:53:56] Phasze: maybe I should just switch to appium for ios....
[2013-12-18 08:54:33] lukeis: from conversations yesterday in here, ios7 support is flakey there
[2013-12-18 08:54:42] Phasze: :S
[2013-12-18 08:55:05] Phasze: so you're saying I should just go to 6.1 anyway ? :P
[2013-12-18 08:55:12] jack090: yea 6.1 works just fine
[2013-12-18 08:55:14] lukeis: nope
[2013-12-18 08:55:19] lukeis: but yeah
[2013-12-18 08:55:32] Phasze: *searches for download link on this silly mac*
[2013-12-18 08:55:45] jack090: for use the release version of ios-driver
[2013-12-18 08:55:51] lukeis: you know others *do* have ios-driver working right?
[2013-12-18 08:55:53] jack090: er..
[2013-12-18 08:55:57] lukeis: for ios7
[2013-12-18 08:56:04] Phasze: direct me to them lukeis
[2013-12-18 08:56:24] jack090: I have it working on IOS7 using safari
[2013-12-18 08:56:25] lukeis: you're using simulators though right?
[2013-12-18 08:56:31] Phasze: yup
[2013-12-18 08:56:34] Phasze: I have to apparently
[2013-12-18 08:56:44] lukeis: yeah, seemingly
[2013-12-18 08:57:08] lukeis: have you tried using your company's app rather than the iron mountain thing?
[2013-12-18 08:57:22] Phasze: I just requested the .ipa or .app file
[2013-12-18 08:57:24] lukeis: i doubt anyone else has tried to make it run in ios7
[2013-12-18 08:57:35] jack090: i could never get the app's working when building with Maven
[2013-12-18 08:57:57] lukeis: i only ever saw in run in ios6
[2013-12-18 08:58:47] jack090: same lukeis
[2013-12-18 08:58:51] Phasze: I was hoping to have a working test app before moving onto ours, but I may as well try ours heh
[2013-12-18 08:58:54] jack090: I think it works on IO6
[2013-12-18 08:59:12] jack090: phasze I would write your tests using the release version
[2013-12-18 08:59:18] jack090: do everything you got to do
[2013-12-18 08:59:32] jack090: then switch to ios7 when it gets more attention
[2013-12-18 08:59:37] lukeis: if you really really care about the iron mountain app, I would first try and see if you can load it in xcode and build / deploy it ;)
[2013-12-18 08:59:52] Phasze: that's where I did build it :P
[2013-12-18 09:00:11] lukeis: ok then ;)
[2013-12-18 09:00:57] Phasze: now I'm getting simulator session timed out today, just lovely
[2013-12-18 09:02:35] smccarthy2, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-12-18 09:03:47] Phasze: is there a quick way to get ios6.1 from xcode?
[2013-12-18 09:05:23] Phasze: I think I found it (iOS 6.1 Simulator)?

[2013-12-18 09:07:27] jack090: yes
[2013-12-18 09:07:30] jack090: it's under preferences
[2013-12-18 09:07:46] jack090: and then there's a way to "exile" old versions (although I've never done it)
[2013-12-18 09:08:06] Phasze: just need to research how to make it use that simulator now instead
[2013-12-18 09:08:11] Phasze: I think I remember reading about that somewhere
[2013-12-18 09:09:14] jack090: yea google the word exile
[2013-12-18 09:09:37] jack090: I remember that's what they say in documentation somewhere
[2013-12-18 09:09:44] jack090: or when it loads up or something

[2013-12-18 10:01:37] rsalvador: Most tests are passing now in the "refactor" branch with iOS 7, those include app tests in addition of safari. Try: mvn clean verify
[2013-12-18 10:06:55] Phasze: rsalvador: app tests!? How you do this thing!?
[2013-12-18 10:07:46] Phasze: maybe I need the latest refactor branch, mine currently starts the simulator, launches the app, closes the app, and closes the simulator
[2013-12-18 10:09:10] rsalvador: I have been using iOS 7 for safari only, but when I run the tests using "mvn clean verify" I see that many tests also launch the apps and pass
[2013-12-18 10:11:13] Phasze: ah, mvn tests

[2013-12-18 10:21:05] Phasze: is there anything else that needs to be passed to launch ios 6.1 instead of 7?  Right now I'm trying to just pass sdkVersion but it still launches 7.0.3 for some reason
[2013-12-18 10:37:54] Phasze: ah, got it working but I'm still plagued with the same issue of starting the app and closing right after....

[2013-12-18 12:42:01] Phasze: sudo java -jar etc...?
[2013-12-18 12:42:18] jack090: yea
[2013-12-18 12:42:44] jack090: also try changing port around
[2013-12-18 12:42:49] jack090: maybe use like 7777
[2013-12-18 12:42:53] jack090: instead of 5555
[2013-12-18 12:43:12] Phasze: aight, trying sudo now
[2013-12-18 12:43:28] jack090: I run selenium server on mine for the browsers in addition so I have to use different ports

[2013-12-18 13:09:38] jack090: what os you running?
[2013-12-18 13:09:42] jack090: maverick?
[2013-12-18 13:09:47] jack090: or mountain lion
[2013-12-18 13:10:06] Phasze: 10.9.1
[2013-12-18 13:10:14] Phasze: whatever one that is
[2013-12-18 13:11:54] lukeis: mavericks ;)
[2013-12-18 13:12:27] jack090: so have you tried safari?
[2013-12-18 13:12:29] lukeis: we're using mountain lion… don't have mavericks… so that could be another issue :)
[2013-12-18 13:12:59] lukeis: (our IT dept. has not yet blessed mavericks for install anywhere)
[2013-12-18 13:13:12] jack090: phasze I had to wipe my system clean earlier
[2013-12-18 13:13:18] AutomatedTester: lukeis: neither has ours
[2013-12-18 13:13:20] AutomatedTester: I think...
[2013-12-18 13:13:27] AutomatedTester: but there are some who have updated anyway
[2013-12-18 13:13:34] lukeis: we have a date though!… Jan. 6 i believe
[2013-12-18 13:13:41] Phasze: jack090: wipe it clean?  reformat?
[2013-12-18 13:13:43] jack090: I'm running Mavericks etc..
[2013-12-18 13:13:50] jack090: yea I had a machine that just wouldn't work
[2013-12-18 13:13:55] jack090: I think I saw similar errors
[2013-12-18 13:13:58] lukeis: AutomatedTester: they blocked the update here :)
[2013-12-18 13:14:10] AutomatedTester: They wouldnt do that here
[2013-12-18 13:14:14] jack090: but I don't want to send you on a wild goose chase
[2013-12-18 13:14:39] jack090: I have 3 macs and 2 worked just fine
[2013-12-18 13:14:44] jack090: and 1 wouldn't work until I formatted it
[2013-12-18 13:15:00] jack090: 2 have mavericks and 1 is on mountain lion
[2013-12-18 13:15:07] jack090: it's running my IOS 6 emulator
[2013-12-18 13:15:12] jack090: the other 2 are running 7
[2013-12-18 13:15:13] Phasze: hmmm
[2013-12-18 13:15:27] Phasze: can mac reformat without a disc?
[2013-12-18 13:15:34] jack090: although the IOS 6 machine I think i'm going to run 5 since Ipad originals run that version
[2013-12-18 13:15:42] jack090: yea it's a bitch
[2013-12-18 13:15:55] jack090: if you don't have anything you don't care about
[2013-12-18 13:16:10] jack090: get a flash drive and there's a site that I did it on
[2013-12-18 13:16:22] jack090: one sec i'll get a link
[2013-12-18 13:17:00] jack090: http://lifehacker.com/how-to-create-an-os-x-mavericks-usb-installation-drive-1450280026
[2013-12-18 13:18:33] Phasze: and I don't need an OS cd-key or something?
[2013-12-18 13:18:36] jack090: phasze I would only recommend doing that in a "break the glass" scenario
[2013-12-18 13:18:46] jack090: nope maverick's is free to all mac's that will run it
[2013-12-18 13:18:51] Phasze: already banging my head against the wall
[2013-12-18 13:19:18] jack090: yea sometimes it's faster just to break the glass and format
[2013-12-18 13:19:26] jack090: I did that to the machine that wouldn't work
[2013-12-18 13:19:32] Phasze: need to find a USB drive now....
