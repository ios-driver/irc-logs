[2013-12-19 09:16:53] jack090: nicegraham do you remember what I need to do to make the prompt asking for a password to run ios-driver?
[2013-12-19 09:17:06] jack090: er.. when a test starts (aka at night when I'm not around)
[2013-12-19 09:17:07] nicegraham: to make it go away?
[2013-12-19 09:17:10] jack090: yea
[2013-12-19 09:17:18] jack090: to make sure it has permissions all the time
[2013-12-19 09:17:18] nicegraham: are you on mavericks?
[2013-12-19 09:17:20] jack090: yuo
[2013-12-19 09:17:22] jack090: yup
[2013-12-19 09:17:26] nicegraham: then no
[2013-12-19 09:17:30] jack090: :-(
[2013-12-19 09:17:30] nicegraham: it's changed
[2013-12-19 09:17:33] jack090: boo
[2013-12-19 09:17:38] nicegraham: it used to the authorization file
[2013-12-19 09:17:40] jack090: I did it on mountain lion
[2013-12-19 09:17:49] nicegraham: but now there's a db somewhere apparently
[2013-12-19 09:17:49] jack090: yea that's what I did
[2013-12-19 09:18:03] jack090: hrm.. I'll look it up
[2013-12-19 09:18:08] nicegraham: rsalvador: do you know?
[2013-12-19 09:18:09] jack090: I definitely need it

[2013-12-19 09:19:20] jack090: I think this is it
[2013-12-19 09:19:31] jack090: I'll come up with the exact commands and add them to our documentation
[2013-12-19 09:19:56] nicegraham: cheers

[2013-12-19 11:03:58] jack090: I don't want to put that in the documentation yet as I don't know 100% if it takes care of it
[2013-12-19 11:04:11] jack090: I'll wait and see if I get prompted later tonight
