[2013-05-13 10:38:16] freynaud: JNA mapping is a pain.
[2013-05-13 10:38:30] freynaud: anyone interested in sharing that pain ? :)
[2013-05-13 10:39:07] lukeis: i'm not even sure what that is :)
[2013-05-13 10:39:28] freynaud: bridge between C and Java
[2013-05-13 10:39:40] freynaud: verbosity of java, with C memory managt
[2013-05-13 10:39:41] lukeis: oh, that does sound painful
[2013-05-13 10:39:51] freynaud: best of both world
[2013-05-13 10:40:10] freynaud: there is an automatic generator for it
[2013-05-13 10:40:16] freynaud: that seems to work
[2013-05-13 10:40:25] freynaud: but gets confused by some pointers
[2013-05-13 10:40:33] freynaud: and with C, that doesn't get far
[2013-05-13 10:41:35] lukeis: confused pointersâ€¦ I know enough C to know that's a world of pain if that happens
[2013-05-13 10:43:00] freynaud: worked fine enough for strings
[2013-05-13 10:43:07] freynaud: then there was this char***
