[2013-05-16 05:53:00] nicegraham: freynaud: yt?
[2013-05-16 05:53:55] freynaud: yes
[2013-05-16 05:54:00] nicegraham: cool
[2013-05-16 05:54:09] nicegraham: we're debugging something odd here
[2013-05-16 05:54:16] freynaud: ok
[2013-05-16 05:54:19] nicegraham: wondering if you've come across anything similar
[2013-05-16 05:54:20] freynaud: what's happening ?
[2013-05-16 05:54:31] nicegraham: we're running multiple vms on a single machine
[2013-05-16 05:54:44] nicegraham: if we login at the same time on more than one of them
[2013-05-16 05:54:52] nicegraham: at least one of the logins fails
[2013-05-16 05:55:02] nicegraham: on the server side they're seeing the login post
[2013-05-16 05:55:07] freynaud: login as in osx login ?
[2013-05-16 05:55:14] nicegraham: but payload is empty
[2013-05-16 05:55:17] nicegraham: no site login
[2013-05-16 05:55:26] nicegraham: it's doing a post with parameters
[2013-05-16 05:55:42] nicegraham: so one of the login's works and the username/password are sent
[2013-05-16 05:55:47] freynaud: that has nothing to do with ios-driver does it ?
[2013-05-16 05:55:56] nicegraham: I don't think so
[2013-05-16 05:56:07] nicegraham: we're filling in the form and clicking 'login'
[2013-05-16 05:56:27] freynaud: i've seen a lot of bugs on the site i test :)
[2013-05-16 05:56:30] nicegraham: so if anything it's to do with the Vms / simulators / network
[2013-05-16 05:56:38] freynaud: but i Â don't think it's relevant for yours :)
[2013-05-16 05:56:55] nicegraham: the devs are saying it's not their code
[2013-05-16 05:56:58] freynaud: probably some wierd timeout issue
[2013-05-16 05:57:12] nicegraham: it only happens when multiple logins happen at the same time
[2013-05-16 05:57:12] freynaud: sure. The devs always produce bug free code
[2013-05-16 05:57:16] nicegraham: from the same physical machine
[2013-05-16 05:57:17] freynaud: it's well known
[2013-05-16 05:57:20] nicegraham: :) i know
[2013-05-16 05:58:02] nicegraham: https://gist.github.com/nicegraham/5591530
[2013-05-16 05:58:10] freynaud: if they're sure enough to take the blame if anything goes wrong in prod, then you can just leave that alone and do something else :)
[2013-05-16 05:58:11] nicegraham: that's what they're seeing on the server
[2013-05-16 05:58:32] nicegraham: well, we can't run concurrently if we can't login....
[2013-05-16 06:00:35] nicegraham: this site is also live and we're not seeing any login issues in the wild
[2013-05-16 06:00:54] nicegraham: it's definitely something to do with the setup we have
[2013-05-16 06:01:27] freynaud: is the POST done by some JS code ?
[2013-05-16 06:02:09] freynaud: if yes, it could be that the VM are actually creating a slow-ish envt showing some timeing issues you don't see on a ream machine
[2013-05-16 06:02:09] nicegraham: checking...
[2013-05-16 06:10:53] nicegraham: freynaud: yeah it's a js post
[2013-05-16 06:11:07] nicegraham: what VM software are you using btw? esx did you say?
[2013-05-16 06:11:16] freynaud: eBay is VMware
[2013-05-16 06:11:18] nicegraham: we're using vmware fusion
[2013-05-16 06:11:22] freynaud: moving to openStack
[2013-05-16 06:16:38] nicegraham: freyanud: why are you moving? Are you going to run it internally on in their cloud?
[2013-05-16 06:17:20] freynaud: not sure
[2013-05-16 06:17:37] freynaud: ebay and paypal runs tens of thousands of VMs
[2013-05-16 06:17:59] freynaud: I assume someone did some extensive research, but I didn't really check
[2013-05-16 06:18:16] freynaud: I just saw I need to learn something new. I didn't ask why :)
[2013-05-16 06:18:54] nicegraham: fair enough,
[2013-05-16 06:19:04] nicegraham: I'll check with nirvdrum later as to what he's using
[2013-05-16 06:19:21] nicegraham: and if he's seen anything weird like this post thing
[2013-05-16 06:23:56] freynaud: he's using AC2
[2013-05-16 06:26:10] nicegraham: qu'est ce que c'est
[2013-05-16 06:26:12] nicegraham: ?
[2013-05-16 06:26:35] nicegraham: ec2?
[2013-05-16 06:30:10] freynaud: yes sorry
