[2013-05-22 01:52:21] dgrace, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-05-22 01:52:37] nicegraham: hey
[2013-05-22 01:52:55] nicegraham: dev_kumar
[2013-05-22 01:53:01] dev_kumar: i have setup as i told u so where is the problem
[2013-05-22 01:53:21] nicegraham: freynaud believes it is due to the name of the device
[2013-05-22 01:53:36] nicegraham: we think the system can't parse it because of the char set it's using
[2013-05-22 01:54:00] nicegraham: did you try his suggestion of renaming the device to just regular characters?
[2013-05-22 01:54:01] dev_kumar: but i have changed the name and trid again
[2013-05-22 01:54:10] nicegraham: what did you change it to?
[2013-05-22 01:54:32] dev_kumar: myipad
[2013-05-22 01:54:38] nicegraham: ok
[2013-05-22 01:54:53] nicegraham: freynaud wrote all the code in that area, so you really need to talk to him
[2013-05-22 01:55:05] nicegraham: hopefully he'll be online this morning
[2013-05-22 01:55:20] dev_kumar: ok
[2013-05-22 01:55:24] nicegraham: with the new ipad name, you get the exact same error as before?
[2013-05-22 01:55:34] dev_kumar: yes
[2013-05-22 01:55:59] dev_kumar: and i have tried it by manually archiving my apps
[2013-05-22 01:56:27] nicegraham: can you create a gist of your console window
[2013-05-22 01:56:36] nicegraham: including all the xml that gets printed out?
[2013-05-22 01:56:38] dev_kumar: and then i was able to launch the app on myipad but suddenly it crashed
[2013-05-22 01:56:42] nicegraham: :gist
[2013-05-22 01:57:16] dev_kumar: ok
[2013-05-22 01:57:27] nicegraham: I have a meeting now - I'll be back later
[2013-05-22 01:57:40] dev_kumar: ok
