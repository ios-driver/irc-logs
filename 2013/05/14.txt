[2013-05-14 06:12:12] nicegraham: hey, freynaud
[2013-05-14 06:12:18] nicegraham: I reckoned that might be the case
[2013-05-14 06:14:21] nicegraham: freynaud: https://gist.github.com/nicegraham/5575760
[2013-05-14 06:14:31] nicegraham: looks like something else is missing too
[2013-05-14 06:29:59] freynaud: ah, crap
[2013-05-14 06:30:13] freynaud: Martin changed the build system :)
[2013-05-14 06:36:40] nicegraham: ah, no problem
[2013-05-14 06:37:11] nicegraham: can all the dependencies be packaged? or do we need to install libimobile ourselves?
[2013-05-14 06:37:20] nicegraham: I had a look on the site and it's a bit confusing tbh
[2013-05-14 06:40:24] freynaud: it's C :)
[2013-05-14 06:40:35] freynaud: when you're used to maven and java, it's a bit of a shock
[2013-05-14 06:41:42] nicegraham: yep
[2013-05-14 06:41:52] nicegraham: I felt like a proper newbie :)
[2013-05-14 06:42:57] freynaud: this is a tuff one
[2013-05-14 06:43:09] freynaud: I checked with Martin, the guy working on libimobile
[2013-05-14 06:43:27] freynaud: we need to be careful the way we build the library
[2013-05-14 06:43:47] nicegraham: ok
