[2013-05-14 06:12:12] nicegraham: hey, freynaud
[2013-05-14 06:12:18] nicegraham: I reckoned that might be the case
[2013-05-14 06:14:21] nicegraham: freynaud: https://gist.github.com/nicegraham/5575760
[2013-05-14 06:14:31] nicegraham: looks like something else is missing too
[2013-05-14 06:29:59] freynaud: ah, crap
[2013-05-14 06:30:13] freynaud: Martin changed the build system :)
[2013-05-14 06:36:40] nicegraham: ah, no problem
[2013-05-14 06:37:11] nicegraham: can all the dependencies be packaged? or do we need to install libimobile ourselves?
[2013-05-14 06:37:20] nicegraham: I had a look on the site and it's a bit confusing tbh
[2013-05-14 06:40:24] freynaud: it's C :)
[2013-05-14 06:40:35] freynaud: when you're used to maven and java, it's a bit of a shock
[2013-05-14 06:41:42] nicegraham: yep
[2013-05-14 06:41:52] nicegraham: I felt like a proper newbie :)
[2013-05-14 06:42:57] freynaud: this is a tuff one
[2013-05-14 06:43:09] freynaud: I checked with Martin, the guy working on libimobile
[2013-05-14 06:43:27] freynaud: we need to be careful the way we build the library
[2013-05-14 06:43:47] nicegraham: ok

[2013-05-14 10:02:37] nicegraham: nirvdrum: did you sort that ssl issue out?
[2013-05-14 10:02:47] nicegraham: an issue was raised about the same thing earlier
[2013-05-14 10:02:53] nirvdrum: The self-signed cert?
[2013-05-14 10:04:33] nicegraham: trying to dig out the issue/post now
[2013-05-14 10:05:18] nirvdrum: If it's that one, the way around it for now is set the URL via executeScript and window.location = url
[2013-05-14 10:05:57] nirvdrum: Apparently the actual fix requires changing the navigation code to send key strokes for entering the URL.  The current way through Instruments doesn't work when self-signed certs are used.
[2013-05-14 10:06:25] nicegraham: #53
[2013-05-14 10:06:54] nicegraham: wow, that's an odd one
[2013-05-14 10:07:12] nirvdrum: I don't know where Francois got with it.  My understanding was there was another bug with sending the keys.
[2013-05-14 10:08:24] freynaud, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-05-14 10:09:22] nicegraham: actually this issue is a bit different because they are getting the alert
[2013-05-14 10:09:36] nirvdrum: Oh, his issue is different.  He needs to just accept the dialog.
[2013-05-14 10:09:39] nicegraham: but they want to permanently accept it / ignore that error
[2013-05-14 10:10:38] nirvdrum: I don't think that's possible.
[2013-05-14 10:10:47] *nicegraham is heading home...'
[2013-05-14 10:11:20] nirvdrum: It's pretty trivial to handle the dialog in client code.  And if you can do it once, you can do it every time *shrug*
[2013-05-14 10:13:30] nirvdrum: freynaud: What still needs to be done for the 0.7.0 release?
