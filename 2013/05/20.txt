[2013-05-20 08:12:00] nicegraham: nirvdrum: daddy yet?
[2013-05-20 08:13:28] nirvdrum: Indeed.  Since early Wednesday.
[2013-05-20 08:13:54] nicegraham: congrats! I figured your absence may be linked :)
[2013-05-20 08:15:07] nirvdrum: Heh.  I had my laptop with me, but no IRC from the hospital wifi.
[2013-05-20 08:15:15] nicegraham: :)
[2013-05-20 08:15:33] nirvdrum: And then for whatever reason, I decided to reformat it on Friday and clean it out on Saturday.  So I wasn't really back online until yesterday.
[2013-05-20 08:15:55] nirvdrum: It's running a lot quieter with all the dust out and a new batch of thermal paste :-)
[2013-05-20 08:16:10] nicegraham: cathartic too

[2013-05-20 09:52:24] nicegraham: nirvdrum: you haven't still been getting those location header errors have you?
[2013-05-20 09:52:55] nirvdrum: I'd have to dig through my logs.  They certainly dropped off in frequency though.
[2013-05-20 09:53:25] nicegraham: yeah, we were still getting them
[2013-05-20 09:53:36] nicegraham: dgrace thinks he's fixed it though :)
[2013-05-20 09:53:46] nicegraham: running more tests tonight and tomorrow
