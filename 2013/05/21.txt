[2013-05-21 06:29:03] nirvdrum: nicegraham: Good find on #35.  I guess that's why I'm not really seeing it anymore.  I don't use native apps.
[2013-05-21 06:29:19] nicegraham: yeah, it was a pig
[2013-05-21 06:29:41] nicegraham: our runs have been solid since darragh added that extra check
[2013-05-21 06:34:34] nicegraham: nirvdrum: how have your vms been behaving? how many have you been able to run on a single machine?

[2013-05-21 06:42:32] nirvdrum: I had to pause that project because my wife was spitting a kid out.  I'm hoping to get back to it today or tomorrow.
[2013-05-21 06:43:10] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: spitting? didnt you get the memo about children coming from another part of the body other than the mouth
[2013-05-21 06:43:11] AutomatedTester: :P
[2013-05-21 06:43:35] AutomatedTester: nirvdrum: how is nirvdrum the 2nd?
[2013-05-21 06:43:40] nirvdrum: Heh.
[2013-05-21 06:44:01] nirvdrum: He's fine.  A little yellow so we have a follow-up appointment today.  But otherwise, quite healthy.
[2013-05-21 06:44:21] AutomatedTester: nothing that lot of breast feeding cant sort out
[2013-05-21 06:44:50] nirvdrum: We're doing formula.
[2013-05-21 06:45:11] AutomatedTester: s/breast feeding/feeding with liquid/
[2013-05-21 06:45:20] AutomatedTester: it needs flushing out
[2013-05-21 06:45:50] AutomatedTester: unless its severe
[2013-05-21 06:46:03] nirvdrum: Ahh, yeah.  We were underfeeding him I guess.  They told us to slowly increase when we left the hospital.  So we were bumping up 5 mL per feeding.
[2013-05-21 06:46:33] nirvdrum: Then we saw the pediatrician and she told us to feed him as much as he'd take, so we went up 40 mL or so.  Apparently he was hungry :-P

[2013-05-21 06:54:02] nicegraham: nirvdrum: we've been using vmware fusion and can run 3 vms on our machine with the simulator going and it's solid
[2013-05-21 06:54:14] nicegraham: if we add a solid instance it gets flaky
[2013-05-21 06:54:30] nirvdrum: nicegraham: Cool.  This would be running in ESXi. I have 4 VMs up, but I still need to wire it up to the grid.
[2013-05-21 06:54:49] nicegraham: oh, I added that heartbeat thing client side
[2013-05-21 06:54:59] nicegraham: maybe have a look at it...
