[2013-05-18 07:22:02] arkmon: Hi
[2013-05-18 07:23:24] arkmon: any active users?
[2013-05-18 07:34:29] freynaud: what do you need ?
[2013-05-18 07:50:56] arkmon: I have problem saving stepper value to core data. It says im sending double to ns number
[2013-05-18 08:01:28] admc1, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-05-18 08:04:23] freynaud: do you have the complete stack trace ?
[2013-05-18 08:04:31] freynaud: and the code of your test ?
[2013-05-18 08:05:55] admc1, quitting. (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
[2013-05-18 08:21:24] arkmon: stack trace?
[2013-05-18 08:22:06] freynaud: what exactly are you trying to do when the error appears ?
[2013-05-18 08:25:18] arkmon: when for entity Assesment *newAssesment i say [newAssesmnet setCredit:self.stepperModuleCredit.value];
[2013-05-18 08:26:38] arkmon: but i think i solved it by puting this value to NSUInteger and than do this [newModule setCredit:[NSNumber numberWithInt:value5]];
[2013-05-18 08:26:58] freynaud: this is not ios-driver code is it ?
[2013-05-18 08:27:22] arkmon: right, what is ios-driver than?
[2013-05-18 08:27:39] freynaud: http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/
[2013-05-18 08:28:55] arkmon: ups, im sorry
