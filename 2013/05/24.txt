[2013-05-24 06:12:29] nirvdrum: nicegraham: Ever work out why the screenshots weren't rotating for you?
[2013-05-24 06:13:19] nicegraham: no, not yet
[2013-05-24 06:13:26] nicegraham: I've barely had a minute today
[2013-05-24 06:14:52] nirvdrum: No worries.
[2013-05-24 06:15:19] nicegraham: freynaud was on a couple of minutes ago
[2013-05-24 06:15:27] nicegraham: he said he'd talk to re java 7 this evening
[2013-05-24 06:16:17] nicegraham: is that bug in all j7 versions or just from u16 onwards/
[2013-05-24 06:17:01] nirvdrum: It's not entirely clear.  There may have been two bugs and one was cleared up.  Or it's the same bug, but different contexts.
[2013-05-24 06:17:55] nicegraham: is the issue with java or with vmware? as in who needs to fix it?
[2013-05-24 06:31:06] nirvdrum: Java.
[2013-05-24 06:31:22] nirvdrum: It works in Java 6, it broke in Java 7.  It's a regression.
[2013-05-24 06:31:45] nirvdrum: But Oracle hasn't pushed a non-security Java 7 release in over a year.
[2013-05-24 06:31:59] nirvdrum: And it's not planning to until August, IIRC.
[2013-05-24 06:32:15] nicegraham: hmm
[2013-05-24 06:35:15] dgrace: nirvdrum: a fix I made yesterday broke some stuff, apologies. Did you see the comment I tagged you in github regarding the fix?
[2013-05-24 06:36:06] nirvdrum: Not yet.  I've been doing some technical documentation.
[2013-05-24 06:37:12] dgrace: no worries. I have an amended fix proposal and explanation in there. Let me know what you think when you get a chance.

[2013-05-24 08:13:51] nirvdrum: dgrace: I guess I don't get why browserName is or should be "IOS Simulator"
[2013-05-24 08:18:12] dgrace: nirvdrum: This is how it is implemented in ios-grid (IOSCapabilitiesMonitor), for our Native app we target browserName as IOS Simulator, and use device to target iphone, ipad etc, CFBundleName to target the native app we need.
[2013-05-24 08:19:22] nirvdrum: That just seems weird.  It's not a browser.
[2013-05-24 08:21:01] dgrace: maybe we should rethink that so.. I'll talk to nicegraham about it.
[2013-05-24 08:21:21] dgrace: for the time being are you ok with the fix?
[2013-05-24 08:24:04] nirvdrum: Does isBrowserNameADevice exist?
[2013-05-24 08:24:35] dgrace: i'm gonna commit that as part of the new fix
[2013-05-24 08:24:47] dgrace: was waiting to run it past ye
