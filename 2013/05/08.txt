[2013-05-08 13:28:49] nirvdrum: Well, that certainly sucks.
[2013-05-08 13:29:15] nicegraham: you're special nirvdrum
[2013-05-08 13:29:19] nicegraham: works for everyone else :)
[2013-05-08 13:29:36] lukeis: sorry man :-/  i don't remember anything else, it was 1 mere change to the authorization file
[2013-05-08 13:29:42] nirvdrum: I have three machines it's not working on, so I may very well be the problem.
[2013-05-08 13:30:02] nirvdrum: lukeis: Mind gisting up that file?  Or at least that section?
[2013-05-08 13:30:04] nicegraham: have you found any other guides to do it?
[2013-05-08 13:30:16] lukeis: nirvdrum: no prob, one sec
[2013-05-08 13:30:25] nirvdrum: I didn't look.  I didn't count on this room being full of liars.
[2013-05-08 13:30:37] lukeis: heh

[2013-05-08 13:32:10] nicegraham: god there seems to be a bunch of ways to do it
[2013-05-08 13:32:24] nicegraham: or at least different solutions work for different people
[2013-05-08 13:34:17] lukeis: biab
[2013-05-08 13:35:28] nirvdrum: nicegraham: I'll have to try that.
