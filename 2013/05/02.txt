[2013-05-02 06:20:43] freynaud: nirvdrum: good morning
[2013-05-02 06:20:55] nirvdrum: Hey freynaud.
[2013-05-02 06:21:11] nirvdrum: How's it going?
[2013-05-02 06:21:50] freynaud: working in java, aka parsing xmlk ..
[2013-05-02 06:25:25] nirvdrum: Heh.
[2013-05-02 06:26:53] nirvdrum: I need to figure out this screenshot stuff soon.
[2013-05-02 06:27:03] nirvdrum: I think I'm going to try the app from iphonedriver in ios-driver.
[2013-05-02 06:28:09] freynaud: that won't be safari
[2013-05-02 06:29:31] nirvdrum: It's the same rendering engine though, no?
[2013-05-02 06:29:46] freynaud: i think it's webkit in both cases
[2013-05-02 06:29:53] freynaud: the JS might be a bit different
[2013-05-02 06:30:07] nirvdrum: It's not ideal.  But I need to ship something soon to see if anyone will even pay for it.  Otherwise I'm just wasting my time :-P
[2013-05-02 06:30:12] freynaud: but in that case, you can start chrome on linux, it's supposed to be webkit too :)
[2013-05-02 06:30:19] nirvdrum: And Apple seems quite intent on making this very hard with Safari.
[2013-05-02 06:30:47] nirvdrum: I only need JS to serialize the DOM.  If the rendering engine is the same, the DOM should be the same.
[2013-05-02 06:30:58] freynaud: webdriver is about user interactions. A user cannot see what's not on the screen, so screenshot of the visible screen seens ok to me
[2013-05-02 06:31:07] nirvdrum: If the rendering engine is a different version of WebKit, then that will be problematic.
[2013-05-02 06:31:40] nirvdrum: All the non-ios drivers capture the entire canvas.  It's not solely about interaction :-)
[2013-05-02 06:32:09] nirvdrum: But even if that were the case, I still need more than just the visible screen.
[2013-05-02 06:34:33] freynaud: all the non ios work doesn't make apple comply :)
[2013-05-02 06:37:57] nirvdrum: Oh, I'm amply aware.
[2013-05-02 06:39:46] freynaud: there is a webkit remote protocol call called takeScreenshot
[2013-05-02 06:39:57] freynaud: when they find the time ...
[2013-05-02 06:41:00] nirvdrum: I'd be happy to fix it for Safari, but I don't even know where to begin.  At least on the desktop I have a lot of control.  But on iOS I have to play in their sandbox.
[2013-05-02 06:44:06] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: 2 weeks paternity leave is too much.  8 weeks is insane.
[2013-05-02 06:44:37] *AutomatedTester will remind nirvdrum of this when his boy is around'
[2013-05-02 06:44:52] nirvdrum: I'll be back to work the next day.
[2013-05-02 06:45:25] AutomatedTester: from home or the office?
[2013-05-02 06:45:40] freynaud: I'll be back the next day :) cute ^^
[2013-05-02 06:45:52] nirvdrum: They're usually one in the same.  But I may go to the remote office for some quiet time :-P
[2013-05-02 06:46:08] AutomatedTester: ok... sure... you'll be back "the next day"
[2013-05-02 06:46:15] *AutomatedTester pat pats nirvdrum'
[2013-05-02 06:46:50] nirvdrum: I've worked every day in some capacity for the past 4 years.  I'm quite certain I'll be working the day after the birth.
[2013-05-02 06:47:36] nirvdrum: I can see taking a couple days off.  I can't see 2 weeks.
[2013-05-02 06:47:47] nirvdrum: And I sure as hell can't believe 8 weeks.
[2013-05-02 06:48:04] nirvdrum: That would make me want to work at Yahoo a lot less than their remote policy.
[2013-05-02 06:48:11] AutomatedTester: in Scandanavia, fathers have 4 months off
[2013-05-02 06:48:21] AutomatedTester: its required as well
[2013-05-02 06:48:22] freynaud: you don't have to convince us. You need to convince your boys to behave according to your work schedule :)
[2013-05-02 06:48:34] freynaud: boy
[2013-05-02 06:49:08] nirvdrum: And after the 8 weeks he'll magically start accommodating? :-P
[2013-05-02 06:49:24] freynaud: no. You will.
[2013-05-02 06:49:33] AutomatedTester: at 8 weeks you're a lot closer to a routine than
[2013-05-02 06:49:47] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Well, most European countries have a drastically different attitude towards work than the US.  You have much longer & legally mandated holidays as well.
[2013-05-02 06:50:23] nirvdrum: When I grew up, all the fathers I knew maybe took a couple days off because if you don't work, you don't get paid.  People seemed to turn out fine.
[2013-05-02 06:50:31] freynaud: nirvdrum: it works fine
[2013-05-02 06:51:00] nirvdrum: On any team I've worked on where the father gets paternity leave, it's been nothing but a headache.  They won't answer simple emails or phone calls and my life turns to hell because they wanted to have a kid.
[2013-05-02 06:51:35] nirvdrum: It's not like their letting their wombs heal.  They're just taking time off.
[2013-05-02 06:52:00] nirvdrum: But, I digress.  I didn't want to argue with you over Twitter ;-)
[2013-05-02 07:14:22] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Who'd you ultimately book your flight with?
[2013-05-02 07:14:34] AutomatedTester: Air Canada
[2013-05-02 07:14:47] nirvdrum: Let me know what you think of them.
[2013-05-02 07:14:48] AutomatedTester: I like them a lot
[2013-05-02 07:14:55] AutomatedTester: I <3 Air Canada
[2013-05-02 07:15:18] AutomatedTester: not as much as Singapore Airlines
[2013-05-02 07:15:33] AutomatedTester: but thats in a totally different league
[2013-05-02 07:16:35] nirvdrum: I haven't done a lot of international travel.  I think I've only flown Virgin Atlantic and Air France.
[2013-05-02 07:16:45] nirvdrum: I wasn't impressed with Air France.
[2013-05-02 07:17:00] AutomatedTester: yea, Air France is crap
[2013-05-02 07:17:23] nicegraham: etihad is the best I've flown
[2013-05-02 07:17:25] nicegraham: seriously nice
[2013-05-02 07:17:41] AutomatedTester: etihad is ok
[2013-05-02 07:17:56] AutomatedTester: seriously... Singapore Airlines is the best in the world at the moment
[2013-05-02 07:18:08] AutomatedTester: well, airlines I have flown in the last year
[2013-05-02 07:18:09] nicegraham: I haven't used them
[2013-05-02 07:18:24] *AutomatedTester gets around a little'
[2013-05-02 07:18:33] nirvdrum: I'd love to visit Asia, but I'm convinced I would die of starvation within a week.
[2013-05-02 07:18:41] nicegraham: KLM, virgin, emirates and BA were all below etihad for me at least
[2013-05-02 07:19:00] AutomatedTester: I put BA and Air France in the same league
[2013-05-02 07:19:06] nicegraham: yeah

[2013-05-02 07:32:10] nirvdrum: nicegraham: It looks like scroll by JavaScript might give me the control I'm looking for.
[2013-05-02 07:32:23] nicegraham: cool :)
[2013-05-02 07:34:15] nirvdrum: Is there any way to hide the control bar at the bottom?
[2013-05-02 07:35:10] nicegraham: in iphonedriver?
[2013-05-02 07:35:31] nirvdrum: ios-driver.
[2013-05-02 07:36:05] nicegraham: i don't get a controller bar at the bottom in safari
[2013-05-02 07:37:20] nirvdrum: Hmm . . . I have one with back & forward buttons.  A bookmark button.  And so on.
[2013-05-02 07:39:52] nicegraham: no, I have the standard control at the top but nothing at the bottom.
[2013-05-02 07:43:06] nirvdrum: Odd.  I'm just running with the "Regular" iPhone.
