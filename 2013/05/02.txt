[2013-05-02 06:20:43] freynaud: nirvdrum: good morning
[2013-05-02 06:20:55] nirvdrum: Hey freynaud.
[2013-05-02 06:21:11] nirvdrum: How's it going?
[2013-05-02 06:21:50] freynaud: working in java, aka parsing xmlk ..
[2013-05-02 06:25:25] nirvdrum: Heh.
[2013-05-02 06:26:53] nirvdrum: I need to figure out this screenshot stuff soon.
[2013-05-02 06:27:03] nirvdrum: I think I'm going to try the app from iphonedriver in ios-driver.
[2013-05-02 06:28:09] freynaud: that won't be safari
[2013-05-02 06:29:31] nirvdrum: It's the same rendering engine though, no?
[2013-05-02 06:29:46] freynaud: i think it's webkit in both cases
[2013-05-02 06:29:53] freynaud: the JS might be a bit different
[2013-05-02 06:30:07] nirvdrum: It's not ideal.  But I need to ship something soon to see if anyone will even pay for it.  Otherwise I'm just wasting my time :-P
[2013-05-02 06:30:12] freynaud: but in that case, you can start chrome on linux, it's supposed to be webkit too :)
[2013-05-02 06:30:19] nirvdrum: And Apple seems quite intent on making this very hard with Safari.
[2013-05-02 06:30:47] nirvdrum: I only need JS to serialize the DOM.  If the rendering engine is the same, the DOM should be the same.
[2013-05-02 06:30:58] freynaud: webdriver is about user interactions. A user cannot see what's not on the screen, so screenshot of the visible screen seens ok to me
[2013-05-02 06:31:07] nirvdrum: If the rendering engine is a different version of WebKit, then that will be problematic.
[2013-05-02 06:31:40] nirvdrum: All the non-ios drivers capture the entire canvas.  It's not solely about interaction :-)
[2013-05-02 06:32:09] nirvdrum: But even if that were the case, I still need more than just the visible screen.
[2013-05-02 06:34:33] freynaud: all the non ios work doesn't make apple comply :)
[2013-05-02 06:37:57] nirvdrum: Oh, I'm amply aware.
[2013-05-02 06:39:46] freynaud: there is a webkit remote protocol call called takeScreenshot
[2013-05-02 06:39:57] freynaud: when they find the time ...
