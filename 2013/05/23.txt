[2013-05-23 00:29:10] freynaud: morning
[2013-05-23 00:32:26] dev_kumar: hey freynaud
[2013-05-23 00:32:37] dev_kumar: how are you?
[2013-05-23 00:43:24] freynaud: good , you ?
[2013-05-23 00:54:40] dev_kumar: good
[2013-05-23 00:56:07] dev_kumar: i have a dout could you clear it?
[2013-05-23 00:56:45] dev_kumar: Is it possible to test already installed apps in real device by ios-driver ?
[2013-05-23 00:58:25] freynaud: yes, if you install them with the correct certificate etc
[2013-05-23 00:58:49] freynaud: basically, if from xcode you install it clicking Product>Profile
[2013-05-23 00:59:12] freynaud: that will install it with the correct entitelemnt and with your provisioning rofile
[2013-05-23 00:59:22] freynaud: after that you can use the app with instruments
[2013-05-23 00:59:35] dev_kumar: i'm talking about those apps which is already installed when i purchased my ipad
[2013-05-23 01:00:29] freynaud: you cannot
[2013-05-23 01:00:48] freynaud: or you need to jailbreak
[2013-05-23 01:01:24] dev_kumar: after jailbreak what procedure i need to follow
[2013-05-23 01:01:47] freynaud: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/DeveloperTools/Conceptual/InstrumentsUserGuide/UsingtheAutomationInstrument/UsingtheAutomationInstrument.html
[2013-05-23 01:01:51] freynaud: look at the note
[2013-05-23 01:02:00] freynaud: I've not played with jailbreak myself
[2013-05-23 01:02:20] freynaud: i don't really see the point. If you're testing the app, you should have access to it
[2013-05-23 01:02:39] freynaud: the only possible exception to that is for safari
[2013-05-23 01:02:52] dev_kumar: how ?
[2013-05-23 01:05:26] dev_kumar: is there any other way to test these kinds of already installed applications
[2013-05-23 01:05:48] freynaud: no
[2013-05-23 01:06:41] freynaud: if the app is installed by another company, why would you test it ?
[2013-05-23 01:06:44] freynaud: it's their problem
[2013-05-23 01:06:58] dev_kumar: so i need source code first to install my app on my device then i can test it. am i right?
[2013-05-23 01:07:16] freynaud: i'm not super familiar with app signing
[2013-05-23 01:07:26] dev_kumar: ok
[2013-05-23 01:07:29] freynaud: you may be able to resign the binary
[2013-05-23 01:07:48] freynaud: but that still mean that you have to work with the developers producing that binary
[2013-05-23 01:08:16] dev_kumar: ok

[2013-05-23 05:55:32] nicegraham: dev_kumar
[2013-05-23 05:55:50] nicegraham: I've updated the plist parser library to the latest and we don't get that issue
[2013-05-23 05:55:57] nicegraham: but there's another problem in that xml
[2013-05-23 05:56:01] nicegraham: which our code can't parse
[2013-05-23 05:56:05] nicegraham: I'm looking at that now

[2013-05-23 06:29:14] dev_kumar: nicegraham i have something to ask .
[2013-05-23 06:29:24] nicegraham: yeh?
[2013-05-23 06:32:21] dev_kumar: as you suggested me i have uninstalled that one application and now i'm getting all installed application on the link http://localhost:5555/wd/hub/devices/all.
[2013-05-23 06:32:53] nicegraham: good :)
[2013-05-23 06:32:55] dev_kumar: so previously installed applications are also displayed there is that fine
[2013-05-23 06:33:11] nicegraham: they're not installed anymore?
[2013-05-23 06:33:29] nicegraham: and they're still showing up?
[2013-05-23 06:33:35] dev_kumar: no
[2013-05-23 06:33:52] nicegraham: ok
[2013-05-23 06:33:56] nicegraham: so what's wrong?
[2013-05-23 06:34:11] dev_kumar: i'm talking about those apps which was installed on my ipad when i had purchased it
[2013-05-23 06:34:29] dev_kumar: and those are available still now
[2013-05-23 06:35:14] coreygriggs, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-05-23 06:35:30] nicegraham: ok, that doesn't mean you'll be able to automate them though
[2013-05-23 06:35:41] dev_kumar: yes
[2013-05-23 06:37:10] dev_kumar: is that fine
[2013-05-23 06:37:30] dev_kumar: all the apps are displayed there which i can't automate
[2013-05-23 06:37:43] nicegraham: I assume so
[2013-05-23 06:37:49] nicegraham: you'd need to ask freynaud
[2013-05-23 06:37:57] dev_kumar: ok
[2013-05-23 06:38:51] dev_kumar: thanks for all the discussion.
[2013-05-23 06:39:15] nicegraham: no problem

[2013-05-23 09:00:17] nirvdrum: nicegraham: Sorry, but what was that command you ran for the Instruments auth dialog?
[2013-05-23 09:06:40] ddary, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-05-23 09:07:46] nicegraham: nirvdrum: which one?
[2013-05-23 09:08:10] nirvdrum: Dunno.  It was some sudo command so you don't get prompted to give Instruments permissions to do whatever.
[2013-05-23 09:08:33] nicegraham: ugh....
[2013-05-23 09:08:51] nicegraham: I can't remember tbh, that still giving you guff?
[2013-05-23 09:09:02] nirvdrum: I brought up some new machines.
[2013-05-23 09:09:12] nirvdrum: And the changes lukeis suggested never worked for me *shrug*
[2013-05-23 09:09:38] lukeis: that's very odd :-/
[2013-05-23 09:11:09] nicegraham: it's lukeis fault
[2013-05-23 09:11:16] nicegraham: playing games with your head
[2013-05-23 09:11:48] nicegraham: DevToolsSecurity -enable
[2013-05-23 09:11:58] nicegraham: ^ sudo i guess
[2013-05-23 09:12:07] nirvdrum: Yeah, that looks like it.  Thanks.
[2013-05-23 09:12:23] *lukeis twiddles thumbs like i'm IE in the corner...'
[2013-05-23 09:12:39] nicegraham: sudo /usr/sbin/DevToolsSecurity --enable
[2013-05-23 09:12:46] nicegraham: :)
[2013-05-23 09:13:03] nicegraham: been a while lukeis
[2013-05-23 09:13:14] nicegraham: you not love us anymore? :)
[2013-05-23 09:13:21] lukeis: i do love you ;)
[2013-05-23 09:13:30] lukeis: work likes to prioritize my time elsewhere
[2013-05-23 09:13:48] nicegraham: unreasonable gits
[2013-05-23 09:14:02] nicegraham: how's android going?
[2013-05-23 09:14:14] lukeis: not too bad
[2013-05-23 09:14:25] nicegraham: cool
[2013-05-23 09:14:31] lukeis: reducing flakiness in the whole thing is causing me grief though
[2013-05-23 09:14:44] nicegraham: framework or tests?
[2013-05-23 09:14:50] lukeis: a bit of both
[2013-05-23 09:14:54] nicegraham: we just did an exercise in fixing tests
[2013-05-23 09:15:00] nicegraham: our ci looks better now :)
[2013-05-23 09:15:32] *lukeis trying to get my CI to behave too right now ;) so far tests are really only run locallyâ€¦ that'll change today!'
[2013-05-23 09:15:48] nicegraham: we have them running on the grid
[2013-05-23 09:16:03] nicegraham: our latest fix today was figuring out why the nodes kept disappearing
[2013-05-23 09:16:13] nicegraham: even though I'd implemented the heartbeat on the client side....
[2013-05-23 09:16:19] nicegraham: the mac was going to sleep
[2013-05-23 09:16:21] nicegraham: :)

[2013-05-23 09:16:55] nirvdrum: nicegraham: Heh.  I guess it'd be nice if the grid could send a WOL packet.
[2013-05-23 09:17:10] nicegraham: add that to your todo list  :)
[2013-05-23 09:17:25] nicegraham: our new mac mini can handle more vms too
[2013-05-23 09:17:33] nicegraham: running 4 right now on it
[2013-05-23 09:17:44] nicegraham: the i7 seems to make a big difference over an i5
[2013-05-23 09:17:58] nirvdrum: That's what I'm trying to do right now.
[2013-05-23 09:18:15] nirvdrum: Glad to hear.  I went with the i7.  I figured if I ran 4 VMs, each would have a real core.
[2013-05-23 09:18:32] nirvdrum: I allocated 4 GB RAM to each as well.  That may have been pushing it because I'm overcommitting.
[2013-05-23 09:18:38] nicegraham: now I need to get more!
[2013-05-23 09:18:48] nirvdrum: How much RAM are you allocating?
[2013-05-23 09:18:55] nicegraham: 4 I think
[2013-05-23 09:18:58] nicegraham: the machine has 16
[2013-05-23 09:19:04] nicegraham: ram isn't an issue
[2013-05-23 09:19:09] nicegraham: disk io and cpu are the problems
[2013-05-23 09:19:14] nirvdrum: Yeah.  And the hypervisor takes up some.
[2013-05-23 09:19:26] nirvdrum: I'm using an SSD.  Disk isn't really a problem here :-)
[2013-05-23 09:19:28] nicegraham: freynaud said to make sure spotlight indexing was off
[2013-05-23 09:19:37] nirvdrum: Ahh, good point.
[2013-05-23 09:19:42] nicegraham: good point - pretty sure the new machine is ssd too
[2013-05-23 09:19:56] nicegraham: I think we should create a guide on this stuff too
[2013-05-23 09:20:05] nicegraham: there's been a few lessons learned
[2013-05-23 09:20:11] nirvdrum: SSDs have opened a whole new world for me with virtualization.
[2013-05-23 09:21:30] lukeis: i'm still stuck with a SATA drive on my laptop :(   my upgrade doesn't come till the end of the year
[2013-05-23 09:21:45] nicegraham: drop it!
[2013-05-23 09:22:04] lukeis: yesterday, was pair programming with a co-worker who has SSDâ€¦. same task of building a project took him 3 minâ€¦ took mine 25min!
[2013-05-23 09:22:15] nicegraham: Ouch!
[2013-05-23 09:22:26] lukeis: we used his laptop from then on
[2013-05-23 09:22:45] nicegraham: just do some simple maths, time wasted like that vs the cost of a new machine
[2013-05-23 09:22:49] nicegraham: that's what we did in here
[2013-05-23 09:22:51] nirvdrum: lukeis: That alone should be enough to justify an upgrade.
[2013-05-23 09:22:55] nicegraham: we all got upgrades
[2013-05-23 09:22:58] nirvdrum: SSDs have come way down in price.
[2013-05-23 09:23:18] nirvdrum: Even if you made minimum wage, the time savings would be covered in fairly short order.
[2013-05-23 09:23:29] lukeis: i'm going to be raising my caseâ€¦ right now I don't know who to escalate to ;)  i've lost my manager
[2013-05-23 09:23:43] nicegraham: that was careless :)
[2013-05-23 09:23:45] lukeis: btw we're hiring for a manager (mine in fact!) ;)
[2013-05-23 09:27:10] *nicegraham is audi'
[2013-05-23 09:27:13] nicegraham: laters all
[2013-05-23 09:27:28] lukeis: g'night
