[2013-05-01 03:11:07] freynaud: hi
[2013-05-01 03:11:13] nicegraham: hey
[2013-05-01 03:11:18] freynaud: you didn't commit your changes to libimobile
[2013-05-01 03:11:31] freynaud: the submodule point to a commit that doesn't exist
[2013-05-01 03:11:33] nicegraham: I didn't make any changes?
[2013-05-01 03:11:35] freynaud: can you push it ?
[2013-05-01 03:11:37] nicegraham: ugh, ok
[2013-05-01 03:12:25] nicegraham: can that be pointed back to the proper one? I have a feeling intellj did something here...
[2013-05-01 03:14:36] freynaud: it points to a commit that you haven't pushed I think
[2013-05-01 03:14:43] freynaud: push from libimibile-java
[2013-05-01 03:14:58] nicegraham: but I didn't make any changes in there
[2013-05-01 03:15:16] nicegraham: but when I cloned the repo intellij tries to pull it in
[2013-05-01 03:20:58] nicegraham: if I just reset that commit number to the previous one, is that ok?
[2013-05-01 03:22:52] freynaud: sure
[2013-05-01 03:22:56] freynaud: when you push
[2013-05-01 03:23:06] freynaud: click on the commit id on github
[2013-05-01 03:23:12] freynaud: to double check the link is good
[2013-05-01 03:23:33] freynaud: at the moment it's not fr instance :)
[2013-05-01 03:25:39] nicegraham: yeah, sorry about that
[2013-05-01 03:25:50] nicegraham: trying to figure out where to change it back....
[2013-05-01 03:31:19] freynaud: or push your commits :)
[2013-05-01 03:31:57] nicegraham: I don't want to push anything to libimobile because I didn't change anything on purpose
[2013-05-01 03:32:10] freynaud: fair point
[2013-05-01 03:32:12] nicegraham: I can't figure this out at all
[2013-05-01 03:32:19] freynaud: well, at the moment I cannot checkout the project :)
[2013-05-01 03:32:24] freynaud: which is annoying
[2013-05-01 03:32:33] nicegraham: I can't see where the commit is pointed to.

[2013-05-01 08:10:12] nirvdrum: nicegraham: FYI, I tried that screenshot JS snippet again and execute_script definitely exits before the return statement in the callback.  That would be the case where execute_async_script would be good.
[2013-05-01 08:10:26] nirvdrum: But, as freynaud noted, it doesn't seem to capture images so I can't use it anyway.
[2013-05-01 08:10:31] nirvdrum: I just wanted to fill you in on that.
[2013-05-01 08:10:36] nicegraham: ok, thanks
[2013-05-01 08:10:54] nicegraham: maybe it has a max time it will wait for or something
[2013-05-01 08:11:02] nicegraham: the code looks like it should wait I think
[2013-05-01 08:11:29] nirvdrum: It returns almost immediately.
[2013-05-01 08:11:50] nirvdrum: It just hits the end of the script and returns.  My guess is there's an implicit "return null;"
[2013-05-01 08:12:04] nirvdrum: That's the case with other browsers anyway.
[2013-05-01 08:25:32] freynaud: nirvdrum: it's based on where the image come from
[2013-05-01 08:25:37] freynaud: same server : it works
[2013-05-01 08:25:41] freynaud: different domain :: doesn't
[2013-05-01 08:25:50] nirvdrum: Ahh.
[2013-05-01 08:26:16] nirvdrum: freynaud: So, you said with a native app using UIWebView that I can't execute JS?
[2013-05-01 08:26:42] freynaud: nirvdrum: you can
[2013-05-01 08:27:02] nirvdrum: Okay.  I might have to go that route, even if it's slower.
[2013-05-01 08:27:46] nirvdrum: Scrolling and taking a screenshot is going to be really annoying because I can only scroll half a page at a time.  So stitching the images together is almost certainly going to be error prone.
[2013-05-01 08:42:51] nicegraham: you could make a new scroll
[2013-05-01 08:43:06] nicegraham: which has a start and end point so you could do the full screen
