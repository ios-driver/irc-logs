[2013-05-09 11:11:43] nirvdrum: And we're live.
[2013-05-09 11:11:51] lukeis: mogotest?
[2013-05-09 11:11:57] nirvdrum: Yeah.
[2013-05-09 11:11:59] lukeis: o/
[2013-05-09 11:12:01] nirvdrum: Soft launch.  But it's live.
[2013-05-09 11:12:11] lukeis: nice!
[2013-05-09 11:12:15] nirvdrum: Although I found a small bug with screenshotting in iPhone 5 in portrait.  Probably an off by 1px thing.
[2013-05-09 11:18:33] nicegraham: awesome! :)
[2013-05-09 11:19:46] nicegraham: nivrdrum: your response change has improved reliability
[2013-05-09 11:19:59] nicegraham: we're seeing that location error less, but we did see it once today
[2013-05-09 11:20:04] nicegraham: keeping an eye on it
[2013-05-09 11:21:24] nirvdrum: nicegraham: Cool.  I still need to get heartbeats in place and auto re-registration going.
[2013-05-09 11:21:52] nicegraham: in grid or ios-driver/
[2013-05-09 11:21:53] nicegraham: ?
[2013-05-09 11:22:02] nirvdrum: ios-driver.
[2013-05-09 11:22:17] nirvdrum: Grid already does heart beats and auto unregisters ios-driver nodes when they go down.
[2013-05-09 11:22:33] nicegraham: ok... so what's missing?

[2013-05-09 11:30:03] nirvdrum: If an ios-driver node loses a connection to the grid, it doesn't reestablish it.
[2013-05-09 11:30:52] nicegraham: and the heart beats are two-way?

[2013-05-09 12:00:27] nirvdrum: nicegraham: I think the normal grid nodes just always register on a schedule and the hub just no-ops if they're already registered.
[2013-05-09 12:00:27] nirvdrum: I'd have to double-check that.
[2013-05-09 12:03:04] nicegraham: so they just keep registering?
