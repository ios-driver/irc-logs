[2013-05-07 06:56:25] nicegraham: nirvdrum: saw your note yesterday
[2013-05-07 06:56:44] nicegraham: your header problem was due to the client timing out?
[2013-05-07 06:57:06] nirvdrum: I'm not sure if they were the same problem or not.  But when I fixed the client timeout, the header one seemed to go away.
[2013-05-07 06:57:24] nicegraham: ok
[2013-05-07 06:57:28] nirvdrum: That was all over a LAN.  Now I'm testing this out in a staging environment with a lot more clients and slower links.
[2013-05-07 06:57:34] nirvdrum: It's not holding up very well :-/
[2013-05-07 06:57:43] nicegraham: what part?
[2013-05-07 06:58:27] nirvdrum: I can't get that auth dialog for the simulator to go away on its own, despite following the docs on the web page.
[2013-05-07 06:58:54] nirvdrum: But I missed the prompt and so the new session creation timed out.  Now the hub thinks the session is in use while the node has nothing running.
[2013-05-07 06:59:02] nicegraham: lukeis created a python script to do it
[2013-05-07 06:59:04] nirvdrum: And it's been stuck that way for a little while.
[2013-05-07 07:14:16] nirvdrum: Anyway, I'm debugging this now.  Not fun.

[2013-05-07 10:18:26] dawagner: I haven't really had a chance to get to it, unfortunately :(
[2013-05-07 10:18:46] freynaud: ok
[2013-05-07 10:18:56] freynaud: I'm working on better real device support
[2013-05-07 10:27:44] nirvdrum: nicegraham: If you check the grid before requesting a browser like I do, be aware that the simulator can take a while to start up.  I don't think a slot is marked as used until it has an external session.
[2013-05-07 10:28:42] nicegraham: we do, good to know
[2013-05-07 10:29:08] nicegraham: freynaud: any eta on when we can run multiple sims on the same desktop? :)
[2013-05-07 10:37:38] freynaud: nicegraham: that will be hard
[2013-05-07 10:38:05] nicegraham: I thought it was solved?
[2013-05-07 10:38:06] freynaud: nicegraham: we need facebook to open source their stuff
[2013-05-07 10:38:21] freynaud: then you need to re-write the instruments client for simulator
[2013-05-07 10:38:29] freynaud: it's solved on paper :)
[2013-05-07 10:38:44] nicegraham: have they done the rewrite already too?
[2013-05-07 10:38:55] freynaud: not that I know
[2013-05-07 10:39:06] freynaud: if it's done, it will be libimobile
[2013-05-07 10:39:13] nicegraham: ah, so there's more work than I thought
[2013-05-07 10:39:18] freynaud: :)
[2013-05-07 10:39:42] nicegraham: libimobile as in real devices? or can that be used on sims too?
[2013-05-07 10:41:22] freynaud: they never did simulator before
[2013-05-07 10:41:29] freynaud: they're in the business of real device
[2013-05-07 10:41:44] freynaud: but the hardest part is figuring out the protocol, and that is done
[2013-05-07 10:42:08] freynaud: the part left is the transport protocol, which is different for real device ( usb ) and sim ( inter process comm ? )
[2013-05-07 10:42:11] santiycr, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-05-07 10:42:19] nicegraham: so that can be used instead of instruments right?
[2013-05-07 10:42:28] freynaud: it would make sense to build that in libimobile if the transport protocol is sorted out
[2013-05-07 10:42:41] freynaud: nicegraham: yes
[2013-05-07 10:43:04] freynaud: apple's instruments is hardcoded to a single sim
[2013-05-07 10:43:38] nicegraham: so with that removed we could just start multiple sims? but need to figure out how to direct requests?
[2013-05-07 10:44:13] freynaud: with that removed, we could talk to multiple sim, assuming we can start mutliple sim
[2013-05-07 10:44:23] freynaud: the start multi sim , facebook has done
[2013-05-07 10:45:01] nicegraham: what are they doing with multi sims then if they aren't suing instruments?
[2013-05-07 10:47:47] freynaud: manual test
[2013-05-07 10:48:15] nicegraham: what's that :)
[2013-05-07 10:48:34] nirvdrum: multi sim sure would be nice :-P
[2013-05-07 10:48:54] nirvdrum: I'm looking at ESXi for now.
[2013-05-07 10:49:12] nicegraham: is that not against the eula?
[2013-05-07 10:50:14] nirvdrum: If the host is MacOS X Server, you can virtualize now.
[2013-05-07 10:50:27] nirvdrum: You have to host on Mac hardware though.
[2013-05-07 10:51:25] nicegraham: so you won't be running osx as the base os?
[2013-05-07 10:52:51] nirvdrum: I don't know how ESXi is installed on this machine.  It's leased hardware and they set it up.  I assume they handled the licensing correctly.
[2013-05-07 10:53:12] nirvdrum: Is ESXi the bare metal one?  VMWare has had so many server products, I've lost track.
[2013-05-07 10:53:25] nicegraham: yeah, it's a maze
[2013-05-07 10:53:43] freynaud: nicegraham: yes
[2013-05-07 10:53:56] freynaud: nirvdrum: yes, it is
[2013-05-07 10:54:02] nicegraham: I have esxi running on a dell box for linux vms and some datapower
[2013-05-07 10:54:13] freynaud: you can install ESX as the host on a mac mini, and start from there
[2013-05-07 10:54:33] nirvdrum: Ahh.  Well maybe they changed their licensing again with Mountain Lion?  Mountain Lion changed the whole MacOS X Server product around, since it stopped being its own OS.
[2013-05-07 10:54:51] nirvdrum: freynaud: That's what I'm doing via macstadium.com
[2013-05-07 10:55:08] freynaud: nirvdrum: i don't see the problem with Mountain lion NOT server
[2013-05-07 10:55:30] freynaud: the EULA says mac hardware, and you need to have 1 license to run the OS
[2013-05-07 10:55:50] freynaud: I understand it as you need the hardware and N licenses to run it N times
[2013-05-07 10:55:58] freynaud: but I'm not a laywer :)
[2013-05-07 10:56:05] nicegraham: i don't think so
[2013-05-07 10:56:24] nirvdrum: You can't buy Mac hardware without an OS license, so that should be fairly moot.
[2013-05-07 10:56:30] nicegraham: I think you're allowed run 3 instances per os license
[2013-05-07 10:56:39] nicegraham: something like that
[2013-05-07 10:56:54] coreygriggs, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-05-07 10:57:37] nirvdrum: I need to benchmark a VM host.  I've only used MacStadium for dedicated i5 right now.  But if I can only run a single simulator, that's mostly wasted hardware.
[2013-05-07 10:57:56] lukeis, quitting. (Quit: Leaving.)
[2013-05-07 10:58:34] nirvdrum: Bah, I needed him :-(
[2013-05-07 10:58:36] freynaud: nicegraham: I don't know where your 3 comes from. There is something saying you can run 2 VMs on top of your own os if you virtualize, but that exclude using any kind of remote access. Which is exactly what we do
[2013-05-07 10:59:24] nirvdrum: I'll take my chances with Apple suing me.  I wouldn't risk running a hackintosh for this, but I'm leasing actual mac hardware.  They're getting their money.
[2013-05-07 10:59:53] nicegraham: they are so annoying complicated
[2013-05-07 11:00:15] nicegraham: freynaud: I didn't get that part about remote access
[2013-05-07 11:00:18] nirvdrum: Indeed.  I wish I could just do it on EC2, but c'est la vie, je pense.
[2013-05-07 11:00:54] nirvdrum: So, this "Developer Tools needs to take control" thing.  I've followed the steps in the FAQ: http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/faq.html   But I still see the prompt.
[2013-05-07 11:00:58] nirvdrum: Is that outdated data?
[2013-05-07 11:01:42] nicegraham: I don't think so - lukeis knows better though
[2013-05-07 11:01:43] freynaud_, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-05-07 11:01:50] freynaud_: nicegraham: for the 3 :only one (1) Apple-branded Device may remotely connect at any one time
[2013-05-07 11:02:14] nicegraham: what does that actually mean?
[2013-05-07 11:02:18] freynaud_: i understand it as : you can have 2 VMs, and use that to do some testing and mess up with the system without braking the host
[2013-05-07 11:02:51] freynaud_: but you cannot use the 3 os at the same time, basically having 3 osx for the price of 1

[2013-05-07 11:03:19] nicegraham: ok
[2013-05-07 11:03:26] nicegraham: I need more licences so
[2013-05-07 11:03:33] freynaud_: If you are a commercial enterprise or educational institution, to download, install, use and run one (1) copy of the Apple Software
[2013-05-07 11:03:39] nicegraham: unless we crack this multi sim nut
[2013-05-07 11:03:43] freynaud_: that's what I see in Mountain lion
[2013-05-07 11:04:05] nicegraham: [which I'd prefer obviously]
[2013-05-07 11:04:16] freynaud_: that's what you have when you buy one license, so for me, N license give you N osx to run
[2013-05-07 11:04:35] freynaud_: I don't see that limit of number of instance of OSX per physical mac anywhere
[2013-05-07 11:06:01] nicegraham: no, I don't think that's a problem. I just thought we were getting a 3 for 1 on it
[2013-05-07 11:06:14] nirvdrum: This is all a bit silly.  Isn't a license only like $30 these days?
[2013-05-07 11:06:39] freynaud_: nirvdrum: yes. I bought 20 license for 250£
[2013-05-07 11:06:52] freynaud_: no point trying to save on the license fee. They're really cheap
[2013-05-07 11:07:27] nirvdrum: Right.  They're not $400 Windows 7 licenses.
[2013-05-07 11:07:54] nicegraham: fair point
[2013-05-07 11:08:07] freynaud_: nirvdrum: yes. I bought 20 license for 250£
[2013-05-07 11:08:07] nirvdrum: So, the original point stands.  Virtualization may be the solution for increasing density unless multisim comes around.
[2013-05-07 11:08:21] nirvdrum: I figure I can get 3 - 4 VMs on a single mac mini with an i7.
[2013-05-07 11:11:23] freynaud_: 2 is fine with a dual core
[2013-05-07 11:11:31] freynaud_: 3, the CPU was the bottle neck for me
[2013-05-07 11:11:35] freynaud_: 16Gb, SSD
[2013-05-07 11:11:51] nicegraham: same here
[2013-05-07 11:11:55] nicegraham: 20gb ram

[2013-05-07 12:19:29] nicegraham: it doesn't work because of our requirements

[2013-05-07 12:20:18] AutomatedTester: should workl
[2013-05-07 12:20:25] AutomatedTester: if its not working thats a bug in travis
[2013-05-07 12:20:34] nicegraham: hmm, I'm pretty sure there's something that doesn't
[2013-05-07 12:20:41] AutomatedTester: we get a VM with all access for 12 minutes
[2013-05-07 12:20:46] AutomatedTester: the time might have changed now
[2013-05-07 12:20:50] AutomatedTester: but the VM is ours

[2013-05-07 12:21:47] nicegraham: I don't know what the problem is then
[2013-05-07 12:22:02] nicegraham: he definitely said something was blocking it

[2013-05-07 12:22:30] nicegraham: :log

[2013-05-07 12:26:33] nicegraham: and then the other chmod stuff

[2013-05-07 14:12:54] nirvdrum: AutomatedTester: Sorry, for this project.  It's been set up, but libimobile can't be checked out, so the build fails every time.
[2013-05-07 14:13:15] AutomatedTester: why cant it be checked out?
[2013-05-07 14:13:32] nirvdrum: Because it uses the SSH form of the git URL.
[2013-05-07 14:13:40] nirvdrum: So you need to have SSH keys set up.
[2013-05-07 14:13:52] AutomatedTester: ok, so we can do secure ENVs then
[2013-05-07 14:14:31] nirvdrum: We could also change the git submodule URL.  But I'd imagine that would make it harder for Francois to push from it.

[2013-05-07 14:16:11] nirvdrum: You don't even need to have push permissions to check it out.  But do you do need to have an SSH key associated with a GitHub account in order for it to be checked out, currently.
[2013-05-07 14:17:10] nirvdrum: Heh.  I'm not checking in my private key, secured or otherwise :-P
[2013-05-07 14:17:22] nirvdrum: i'd set up a dummy account for that I guess.

[2013-05-07 14:41:05] lukeis1: heh
[2013-05-07 14:41:08] lukeis1: hello nirvdrum
[2013-05-07 14:41:46] nirvdrum: The FAQ entry on Developer Tools Access needs to take control of another process is a lie: http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/faq.html
[2013-05-07 14:41:55] nirvdrum: Or I'm very incompetent.
[2013-05-07 14:42:05] nirvdrum: But nicegraham said you had a script or something to fix it?
[2013-05-07 14:42:23] lukeis1: did you edit the /etc/authorization file?
[2013-05-07 14:42:30] nirvdrum: Yes.
[2013-05-07 14:42:31] lukeis1: the script merely edits the file
[2013-05-07 14:42:48] nirvdrum: The value listed in the FAQ is what was there though.
[2013-05-07 14:43:09] nirvdrum: It wasn't: <string>rule</string>.  It was <string>user</string>
[2013-05-07 14:43:30] lukeis1: oh it's really wrong in the readme
[2013-05-07 14:43:45] AutomatedTester: night all
[2013-05-07 14:43:50] nirvdrum: Later AutomatedTester
[2013-05-07 14:43:53] lukeis1: need to change <false/>  to <true/>   under <key>allow-root
[2013-05-07 14:44:37] lukeis1: nirvdrum: that make sense ^ ?
[2013-05-07 14:44:56] nirvdrum: Yeah.  Let me take a look.
[2013-05-07 14:45:19] lukeis1: search for system.privilege.taskport  first ;)
[2013-05-07 14:45:34] nirvdrum: Okay.  So should I change that <string> entry back?
[2013-05-07 14:45:54] lukeis1: yes
[2013-05-07 14:45:57] lukeis1: that's what i have
[2013-05-07 14:46:05] lukeis1: only thing i changed was false -> true
[2013-05-07 14:46:33] nirvdrum: And you were all condescending when I didn't read the FAQ entry on this :-P
[2013-05-07 14:46:48] lukeis1: hehe, sorry
[2013-05-07 14:47:09] lukeis1: tribal knowledge it seems
[2013-05-07 14:48:36] lukeis1: it was mainly cause we added the faq at the time of the 0.6 release :) and it was fresh in our minds i think
