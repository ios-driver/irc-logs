[2013-05-07 06:56:25] nicegraham: nirvdrum: saw your note yesterday
[2013-05-07 06:56:44] nicegraham: your header problem was due to the client timing out?
[2013-05-07 06:57:06] nirvdrum: I'm not sure if they were the same problem or not.  But when I fixed the client timeout, the header one seemed to go away.
[2013-05-07 06:57:24] nicegraham: ok
[2013-05-07 06:57:28] nirvdrum: That was all over a LAN.  Now I'm testing this out in a staging environment with a lot more clients and slower links.
[2013-05-07 06:57:34] nirvdrum: It's not holding up very well :-/
[2013-05-07 06:57:43] nicegraham: what part?
[2013-05-07 06:58:27] nirvdrum: I can't get that auth dialog for the simulator to go away on its own, despite following the docs on the web page.
[2013-05-07 06:58:54] nirvdrum: But I missed the prompt and so the new session creation timed out.  Now the hub thinks the session is in use while the node has nothing running.
[2013-05-07 06:59:02] nicegraham: lukeis created a python script to do it
[2013-05-07 06:59:04] nirvdrum: And it's been stuck that way for a little while.
[2013-05-07 07:14:16] nirvdrum: Anyway, I'm debugging this now.  Not fun.
[2013-05-07 07:23:47] nirvdrum: Ever see: bug.Inspected frame has gone ?
[2013-05-07 07:57:03] nirvdrum: dawagner: Do you know off-hand where Selenium Server handles 500s?

[2013-05-07 10:18:17] dawagner: freynaud: Hello!
[2013-05-07 10:18:26] dawagner: I haven't really had a chance to get to it, unfortunately :(
[2013-05-07 10:18:46] freynaud: ok
[2013-05-07 10:18:56] freynaud: I'm working on better real device support
[2013-05-07 10:27:44] nirvdrum: nicegraham: If you check the grid before requesting a browser like I do, be aware that the simulator can take a while to start up.  I don't think a slot is marked as used until it has an external session.
[2013-05-07 10:28:42] nicegraham: we do, good to know
[2013-05-07 10:29:08] nicegraham: freynaud: any eta on when we can run multiple sims on the same desktop? :)
[2013-05-07 10:37:38] freynaud: nicegraham: that will be hard
[2013-05-07 10:38:05] nicegraham: I thought it was solved?
[2013-05-07 10:38:06] freynaud: nicegraham: we need facebook to open source their stuff
[2013-05-07 10:38:21] freynaud: then you need to re-write the instruments client for simulator
[2013-05-07 10:38:29] freynaud: it's solved on paper :)
[2013-05-07 10:38:44] nicegraham: have they done the rewrite already too?
[2013-05-07 10:38:55] freynaud: not that I know
[2013-05-07 10:39:06] freynaud: if it's done, it will be libimobile
[2013-05-07 10:39:13] nicegraham: ah, so there's more work than I thought
[2013-05-07 10:39:18] freynaud: :)
[2013-05-07 10:39:42] nicegraham: libimobile as in real devices? or can that be used on sims too?
[2013-05-07 10:41:22] freynaud: they never did simulator before
[2013-05-07 10:41:29] freynaud: they're in the business of real device
[2013-05-07 10:41:44] freynaud: but the hardest part is figuring out the protocol, and that is done
[2013-05-07 10:42:08] freynaud: the part left is the transport protocol, which is different for real device ( usb ) and sim ( inter process comm ? )
[2013-05-07 10:42:11] santiycr, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-05-07 10:42:19] nicegraham: so that can be used instead of instruments right?
[2013-05-07 10:42:28] freynaud: it would make sense to build that in libimobile if the transport protocol is sorted out
[2013-05-07 10:42:41] freynaud: nicegraham: yes
[2013-05-07 10:43:04] freynaud: apple's instruments is hardcoded to a single sim
[2013-05-07 10:43:38] nicegraham: so with that removed we could just start multiple sims? but need to figure out how to direct requests?
[2013-05-07 10:44:13] freynaud: with that removed, we could talk to multiple sim, assuming we can start mutliple sim
[2013-05-07 10:44:23] freynaud: the start multi sim , facebook has done
[2013-05-07 10:45:01] nicegraham: what are they doing with multi sims then if they aren't suing instruments?
[2013-05-07 10:47:47] freynaud: manual test
[2013-05-07 10:48:15] nicegraham: what's that :)
[2013-05-07 10:48:34] nirvdrum: multi sim sure would be nice :-P
[2013-05-07 10:48:54] nirvdrum: I'm looking at ESXi for now.
[2013-05-07 10:49:12] nicegraham: is that not against the eula?
[2013-05-07 10:50:14] nirvdrum: If the host is MacOS X Server, you can virtualize now.
[2013-05-07 10:50:27] nirvdrum: You have to host on Mac hardware though.
[2013-05-07 10:51:25] nicegraham: so you won't be running osx as the base os?
[2013-05-07 10:52:51] nirvdrum: I don't know how ESXi is installed on this machine.  It's leased hardware and they set it up.  I assume they handled the licensing correctly.
[2013-05-07 10:53:12] nirvdrum: Is ESXi the bare metal one?  VMWare has had so many server products, I've lost track.
[2013-05-07 10:53:25] nicegraham: yeah, it's a maze
[2013-05-07 10:53:43] freynaud: nicegraham: yes
[2013-05-07 10:53:56] freynaud: nirvdrum: yes, it is
[2013-05-07 10:54:02] nicegraham: I have esxi running on a dell box for linux vms and some datapower
[2013-05-07 10:54:13] freynaud: you can install ESX as the host on a mac mini, and start from there
[2013-05-07 10:54:33] nirvdrum: Ahh.  Well maybe they changed their licensing again with Mountain Lion?  Mountain Lion changed the whole MacOS X Server product around, since it stopped being its own OS.
[2013-05-07 10:54:51] nirvdrum: freynaud: That's what I'm doing via macstadium.com
