[2013-08-02 01:29:21] dgrace: ethanclose: hiya, RemoteUIASlider was implemented in this commit - https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/commit/21a0f2e346d0d8f1c14bcbf9d141425501161945 - Maybe take down the latest and give it a try. I've just checked it here and it works fine (tried on uiacatalog.app)

[2013-08-02 04:08:37] freynaud: just checking my network
[2013-08-02 04:08:42] freynaud: ignore :)
[2013-08-02 04:17:28] nicegraham: it's amazing how bad the networks are in these big companies
[2013-08-02 04:17:39] nicegraham: you'd be better going to a cofee shop in a lot of places
[2013-08-02 04:18:20] freynaud: i switch between the corp and the guest network all the time
[2013-08-02 04:18:41] freynaud: I think I'll end up getting a corp laptop, that way I'll have corp wifi too
[2013-08-02 04:19:02] freynaud: so far I resisted. I don't like having IT accessing my stuff
[2013-08-02 04:20:13] nicegraham: :) I have a corporate laptop [mac and windows]
[2013-08-02 04:20:28] nicegraham: the windows one is locked down but they don't seem to be able to do the same with the mac so far
[2013-08-02 04:20:44] freynaud: they don't lock it down.
[2013-08-02 04:21:08] freynaud: but they make mac os look like anything but macos
[2013-08-02 04:21:34] freynaud: and I don't really want to debug the "but it worked on my machine" if I have a non standard os
