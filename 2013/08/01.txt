[2013-08-01 04:59:42] Krishnan: Hi.. I had a quick question
[2013-08-01 05:00:04] Krishnan: Does the IOSDriver take a screenshot of only the visible section on the simulator for a given webpage ?
[2013-08-01 05:01:48] nicegraham: yes
[2013-08-01 05:02:09] Krishnan: oh ok
[2013-08-01 05:02:23] nicegraham: nirvdrum looked at that and I think he has a solution but it's not fast
[2013-08-01 05:02:31] nicegraham: using js
[2013-08-01 05:03:11] Krishnan: freynaud : Btw, I got past the certificate problem with a hack (which you had suggested to someone else).. Luke told me about it.. so i used executeScript() to load the URL, used Alert.accept() to accept the warning and ended up loading the URL :(
[2013-08-01 05:03:18] Krishnan: oh ok
[2013-08-01 05:03:45] nicegraham: ^ you should document that on the wiki :)
[2013-08-01 05:04:42] Krishnan: nicegraham : I would.. But I am scared of freynaud :) He strongly discourages it.. so am not sure if I would be doing the right thing :)
[2013-08-01 05:05:07] nicegraham: it's something that has been asked before
[2013-08-01 05:05:20] nicegraham: and we don't currently have a proper fix
[2013-08-01 05:05:30] Krishnan: I was basically pressed against the wall, and had to complete my POC in my org.. we use self signed certs.. its going to be a herculean task for me to get my org to buy around 3000+ certs for all my test environments
[2013-08-01 05:05:37] nicegraham: there's an issue on github in that area
[2013-08-01 05:05:42] Krishnan: and am just this tiny amoeba in my org :)
[2013-08-01 05:05:48] nicegraham: so even documenting it as a comment there
[2013-08-01 05:06:04] nicegraham: when that issue get's closed the hack is no longer relevant
[2013-08-01 05:06:10] Krishnan: oh is it.. Well I will definitely document it there for sure nicegraham
[2013-08-01 05:06:11] nicegraham: and in the meantime that's how you get around it
[2013-08-01 05:06:16] Krishnan: lemme do it right away
[2013-08-01 05:06:50] nicegraham: https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/issues/96
[2013-08-01 05:08:14] Krishnan: Found it :)
[2013-08-01 05:09:49] Krishnan: Done
[2013-08-01 05:10:03] nicegraham: good man - your first ios-driver contribution?!
[2013-08-01 05:10:38] Krishnan: Lol :) yeah... wish I can do more than just put in a comment in a bug nicegraham :)
[2013-08-01 05:10:41] Krishnan: But yep.. its a start
[2013-08-01 05:11:09] Krishnan: I managed to put a bug fix in TestNG.. lets see when do I get to do it in IOSDriver/WebDriver :) Its a long standing ambition
[2013-08-01 05:11:14] nicegraham: it's all a help
[2013-08-01 05:11:19] Krishnan: yeah..
