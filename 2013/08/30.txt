[2013-08-30 05:18:48] nicegraham: Ah ok
[2013-08-30 05:21:10] ddary: ok
[2013-08-30 05:21:59] ddary: what is the branch you work on?
[2013-08-30 05:22:07] ddary: there are so many...
[2013-08-30 05:26:05] freynaud: 6 branches
[2013-08-30 05:26:13] freynaud: 2 for docs, one for travis
[2013-08-30 05:26:29] freynaud: that  leaves master for release, dev for dev, and 1 more
[2013-08-30 05:26:34] freynaud: this is manageable :)
[2013-08-30 05:30:57] ddary: :-)
[2013-08-30 05:32:03] ddary: sure, was just confused that you said something should be there an i have not seen it..
