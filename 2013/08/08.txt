[2013-08-08 07:23:41] butterdave: hi there, quick question. I've got ios-driver running selenium tests against the simulator. awesome, but I noticed that it pops up the iphone 3 by default. What can I do to change that to iphone 4 or 5?

[2013-08-08 08:39:14] nicegraham: butterdave: you just need to specify in the desired capabilities which device and variant you want
[2013-08-08 08:39:35] nicegraham: dawagner: he's off skype so that probably means he's gone
[2013-08-08 08:40:08] nicegraham: he's using irccloud so permanently in the channel... in spirit at least :)

[2013-08-08 11:05:28] dawagner: 404
[2013-08-08 11:05:46] lukeis: ughâ€¦ freynaud!!! public links to private repos...
[2013-08-08 11:06:35] dawagner: Do you know how to fix it? :)
[2013-08-08 11:06:51] lukeis: get freynaud to add you to the private repo or have him make it public
[2013-08-08 11:07:20] dawagner: I'm an admin for ios-driver, is that not sufficient?
[2013-08-08 11:07:36] dawagner: I see a repo ios-driver/libimobile-java
[2013-08-08 11:08:04] lukeis: i doubt your an admin of the ios-driver org
[2013-08-08 11:08:11] dawagner: I am
[2013-08-08 11:08:12] lukeis: if you were you'd see https://github.com/ios-driver/libimobiledevice-java

[2013-08-08 11:08:41] lukeis: look at the right side
[2013-08-08 11:08:46] lukeis: which repo's ? :)

[2013-08-08 11:09:31] lukeis: freynaud is the only one that I know of that is
[2013-08-08 11:09:33] dawagner: Ok, so, there's a libimobile-java and a libimobiledevice-java?
[2013-08-08 11:09:38] lukeis: yes
[2013-08-08 11:09:42] dawagner: Ugh.
[2013-08-08 11:10:14] dawagner: Any chance you can send me a tar of it or something? I have an intern trying to get stuff building, and tomorrow's my last day I can do code review before heading on vacation
[2013-08-08 11:10:17] lukeis: you need to get added to this team: https://github.com/organizations/ios-driver/teams/349612
[2013-08-08 11:10:48] lukeis: i'll send you a link to the zip in a sec
