[2013-07-26 04:53:34] Krishnan: Hi
[2013-07-26 04:54:05] Krishnan: Was trying to hook the iOSDriver to the Grid.. and am not able to u'stand what should my desired capabilities look like..
[2013-07-26 04:54:27] Krishnan: My intent is to try and load a web URL (google.com for e.g.,) on the iPhone Simulator using the iOSDriver as a node..
[2013-07-26 05:00:51] nicegraham: hi Krishnan
[2013-07-26 05:01:12] Krishnan: Hi Graham...
[2013-07-26 05:01:30] Krishnan: I decided to look at the Unit tests... for some pointers..
[2013-07-26 05:01:53] Krishnan: It seems to be making use of a IOSDesiredCapabilities class for getting the correct DesiredCapabilities..
[2013-07-26 05:01:53] nicegraham: ok, and did that answer it for you?
[2013-07-26 05:02:11] Krishnan: does it mean that I now have to have a dependency on ios-server jar ?
[2013-07-26 05:02:13] nicegraham: yeah, but you'll need iosdriver in your classpath to avail of that
[2013-07-26 05:02:30] nicegraham: the other option is just to set the capabilities yourself
[2013-07-26 05:03:04] Krishnan: Oh ok... that was what I was going to try next... instantiate the capabilities myself :)
[2013-07-26 05:03:17] Krishnan: That brings me to the next question.. is ios-server library available on Global maven repos ?
[2013-07-26 05:03:24] nicegraham: yep! :)
[2013-07-26 05:03:30] nicegraham: version 0.6.0 is anyway
[2013-07-26 05:03:38] Krishnan: phew!
[2013-07-26 05:03:43] Krishnan: one more question :) if u dont mind
[2013-07-26 05:03:54] nicegraham: fire ahead
[2013-07-26 05:04:04] Krishnan: 1) org.uiautomation:ios-driver-jni:jar:0.7-SNAPSHOT <-- where do I get this guy from ?
[2013-07-26 05:04:07] Krishnan: I checked out the code
[2013-07-26 05:04:28] Krishnan: I updated the module as u had instructed in one of the issues (Maybe u would need to add this to the gh-pages) :)
[2013-07-26 05:04:42] nicegraham: the submodule?
[2013-07-26 05:04:42] Krishnan: but i still cant get the project to build on my windows desktop :(
[2013-07-26 05:04:47] Krishnan: yeah the submodule
[2013-07-26 05:04:51] nicegraham: and is the code there?
[2013-07-26 05:04:56] Krishnan: yep
[2013-07-26 05:05:10] nicegraham: ok - i maybe broke that a little bit trying to release 0.6.1
[2013-07-26 05:05:11] Krishnan: libimobile-java <-- I see it
[2013-07-26 05:05:12] nicegraham: give me a second
[2013-07-26 05:05:20] Krishnan: oh ok
[2013-07-26 05:05:43] Krishnan: oh btw.. incase I can add some thing more to the documentation... u guys accept pull requests ?
[2013-07-26 05:06:18] Krishnan: :) I think the documentation for the checkout of the codebase could be a bit more elaborate.. will try to add it as and when i go through the process so that its a bit more elaborate

[2013-07-26 05:10:07] nicegraham: and git submodule update
[2013-07-26 05:10:17] nicegraham: hopefully that will fix your compile isse
[2013-07-26 05:10:41] Krishnan: i just now did that...
[2013-07-26 05:10:46] Krishnan: running a mvn install now
[2013-07-26 05:11:01] nicegraham: you can -DskipTests or it takes a while :)
[2013-07-26 05:11:37] Krishnan: Now it complains : org.uiautomation:ios-driver-jni:jar:0.6.1 is missing :-|
[2013-07-26 05:11:42] Krishnan: I think am going around in circles here
[2013-07-26 05:12:01] Krishnan: is there any order in which I should be doing the install ?
[2013-07-26 05:12:01] nicegraham: can you check the pom in libimobile
[2013-07-26 05:12:08] nicegraham: it should reference 0.6.1 parent
[2013-07-26 05:12:38] nicegraham: just built it here with no problems

[2013-07-26 05:14:03] Krishnan: first i ran a git submodule update <-- nothing happened on this.. so I ran a git fetch followed by git rebase on the libimobile-java and now its building
[2013-07-26 05:14:12] Krishnan: but too bad.. I missed giving the skipTests :D
[2013-07-26 05:15:06] nicegraham: well, you get to watch them all run
[2013-07-26 05:15:10] nicegraham: that's fun too
[2013-07-26 05:15:15] Krishnan: lol.. :)
[2013-07-26 05:15:16] nicegraham: ok, i'm heading for lunch
[2013-07-26 05:15:25] Krishnan: sure... happy lunching :)
[2013-07-26 05:47:48] nicegraham: Krishnan: if you look at the capabilities you can see what's being set

[2013-07-26 06:46:12] Krishnan: yep.. I got it to work Graham :)
[2013-07-26 06:46:24] Krishnan: am fiddling around with it more to understand better :) This is interesting :D
[2013-07-26 06:57:06] Krishnan: Graham
[2013-07-26 06:57:45] Krishnan: how do I instruct iOSDriver to ignore cert errors ?
[2013-07-26 06:57:47] Krishnan: for a webpage
[2013-07-26 07:05:37] Krishnan: ok.. that was a stupid question :) Please ignore it
