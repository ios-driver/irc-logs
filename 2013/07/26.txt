[2013-07-26 04:53:34] Krishnan: Hi
[2013-07-26 04:54:05] Krishnan: Was trying to hook the iOSDriver to the Grid.. and am not able to u'stand what should my desired capabilities look like..
[2013-07-26 04:54:27] Krishnan: My intent is to try and load a web URL (google.com for e.g.,) on the iPhone Simulator using the iOSDriver as a node..
[2013-07-26 05:00:51] nicegraham: hi Krishnan
[2013-07-26 05:01:12] Krishnan: Hi Graham...
[2013-07-26 05:01:30] Krishnan: I decided to look at the Unit tests... for some pointers..
[2013-07-26 05:01:53] Krishnan: It seems to be making use of a IOSDesiredCapabilities class for getting the correct DesiredCapabilities..
[2013-07-26 05:01:53] nicegraham: ok, and did that answer it for you?
[2013-07-26 05:02:11] Krishnan: does it mean that I now have to have a dependency on ios-server jar ?
[2013-07-26 05:02:13] nicegraham: yeah, but you'll need iosdriver in your classpath to avail of that
[2013-07-26 05:02:30] nicegraham: the other option is just to set the capabilities yourself
[2013-07-26 05:03:04] Krishnan: Oh ok... that was what I was going to try next... instantiate the capabilities myself :)
[2013-07-26 05:03:17] Krishnan: That brings me to the next question.. is ios-server library available on Global maven repos ?
[2013-07-26 05:03:24] nicegraham: yep! :)
[2013-07-26 05:03:30] nicegraham: version 0.6.0 is anyway
[2013-07-26 05:03:38] Krishnan: phew!
[2013-07-26 05:03:43] Krishnan: one more question :) if u dont mind
[2013-07-26 05:03:54] nicegraham: fire ahead
[2013-07-26 05:04:04] Krishnan: 1) org.uiautomation:ios-driver-jni:jar:0.7-SNAPSHOT <-- where do I get this guy from ?
[2013-07-26 05:04:07] Krishnan: I checked out the code
[2013-07-26 05:04:28] Krishnan: I updated the module as u had instructed in one of the issues (Maybe u would need to add this to the gh-pages) :)
[2013-07-26 05:04:42] nicegraham: the submodule?
[2013-07-26 05:04:42] Krishnan: but i still cant get the project to build on my windows desktop :(
[2013-07-26 05:04:47] Krishnan: yeah the submodule
[2013-07-26 05:04:51] nicegraham: and is the code there?
[2013-07-26 05:04:56] Krishnan: yep
[2013-07-26 05:05:10] nicegraham: ok - i maybe broke that a little bit trying to release 0.6.1
[2013-07-26 05:05:11] Krishnan: libimobile-java <-- I see it
[2013-07-26 05:05:12] nicegraham: give me a second
[2013-07-26 05:05:20] Krishnan: oh ok
[2013-07-26 05:05:43] Krishnan: oh btw.. incase I can add some thing more to the documentation... u guys accept pull requests ?
[2013-07-26 05:06:18] Krishnan: :) I think the documentation for the checkout of the codebase could be a bit more elaborate.. will try to add it as and when i go through the process so that its a bit more elaborate
