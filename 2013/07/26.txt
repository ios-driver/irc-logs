[2013-07-26 04:53:34] Krishnan: Hi
[2013-07-26 04:54:05] Krishnan: Was trying to hook the iOSDriver to the Grid.. and am not able to u'stand what should my desired capabilities look like..
[2013-07-26 04:54:27] Krishnan: My intent is to try and load a web URL (google.com for e.g.,) on the iPhone Simulator using the iOSDriver as a node..
[2013-07-26 05:00:51] nicegraham: hi Krishnan
[2013-07-26 05:01:12] Krishnan: Hi Graham...
[2013-07-26 05:01:30] Krishnan: I decided to look at the Unit tests... for some pointers..
[2013-07-26 05:01:53] Krishnan: It seems to be making use of a IOSDesiredCapabilities class for getting the correct DesiredCapabilities..
[2013-07-26 05:01:53] nicegraham: ok, and did that answer it for you?
[2013-07-26 05:02:11] Krishnan: does it mean that I now have to have a dependency on ios-server jar ?
[2013-07-26 05:02:13] nicegraham: yeah, but you'll need iosdriver in your classpath to avail of that
[2013-07-26 05:02:30] nicegraham: the other option is just to set the capabilities yourself
[2013-07-26 05:03:04] Krishnan: Oh ok... that was what I was going to try next... instantiate the capabilities myself :)
[2013-07-26 05:03:17] Krishnan: That brings me to the next question.. is ios-server library available on Global maven repos ?
[2013-07-26 05:03:24] nicegraham: yep! :)
[2013-07-26 05:03:30] nicegraham: version 0.6.0 is anyway
[2013-07-26 05:03:38] Krishnan: phew!
[2013-07-26 05:03:43] Krishnan: one more question :) if u dont mind
[2013-07-26 05:03:54] nicegraham: fire ahead
[2013-07-26 05:04:04] Krishnan: 1) org.uiautomation:ios-driver-jni:jar:0.7-SNAPSHOT <-- where do I get this guy from ?
[2013-07-26 05:04:07] Krishnan: I checked out the code
[2013-07-26 05:04:28] Krishnan: I updated the module as u had instructed in one of the issues (Maybe u would need to add this to the gh-pages) :)
[2013-07-26 05:04:42] nicegraham: the submodule?
[2013-07-26 05:04:42] Krishnan: but i still cant get the project to build on my windows desktop :(
[2013-07-26 05:04:47] Krishnan: yeah the submodule
[2013-07-26 05:04:51] nicegraham: and is the code there?
[2013-07-26 05:04:56] Krishnan: yep
[2013-07-26 05:05:10] nicegraham: ok - i maybe broke that a little bit trying to release 0.6.1
[2013-07-26 05:05:11] Krishnan: libimobile-java <-- I see it
[2013-07-26 05:05:12] nicegraham: give me a second
[2013-07-26 05:05:20] Krishnan: oh ok
[2013-07-26 05:05:43] Krishnan: oh btw.. incase I can add some thing more to the documentation... u guys accept pull requests ?
[2013-07-26 05:06:18] Krishnan: :) I think the documentation for the checkout of the codebase could be a bit more elaborate.. will try to add it as and when i go through the process so that its a bit more elaborate

[2013-07-26 05:10:41] Krishnan: i just now did that...
[2013-07-26 05:10:46] Krishnan: running a mvn install now
[2013-07-26 05:11:01] nicegraham: you can -DskipTests or it takes a while :)
[2013-07-26 05:11:37] Krishnan: Now it complains : org.uiautomation:ios-driver-jni:jar:0.6.1 is missing :-|
[2013-07-26 05:11:42] Krishnan: I think am going around in circles here
[2013-07-26 05:12:01] Krishnan: is there any order in which I should be doing the install ?
[2013-07-26 05:12:01] nicegraham: can you check the pom in libimobile
[2013-07-26 05:12:08] nicegraham: it should reference 0.6.1 parent

[2013-07-26 05:14:03] Krishnan: first i ran a git submodule update <-- nothing happened on this.. so I ran a git fetch followed by git rebase on the libimobile-java and now its building
[2013-07-26 05:14:12] Krishnan: but too bad.. I missed giving the skipTests :D
[2013-07-26 05:15:06] nicegraham: well, you get to watch them all run
[2013-07-26 05:15:10] nicegraham: that's fun too
[2013-07-26 05:15:15] Krishnan: lol.. :)
[2013-07-26 05:15:16] nicegraham: ok, i'm heading for lunch
[2013-07-26 05:15:25] Krishnan: sure... happy lunching :)
[2013-07-26 05:47:48] nicegraham: Krishnan: if you look at the capabilities you can see what's being set
[2013-07-26 05:47:49] nicegraham: https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/blob/dev/common/src/main/java/org/uiautomation/ios/IOSCapabilities.java?source=c
[2013-07-26 06:46:12] Krishnan: yep.. I got it to work Graham :)
[2013-07-26 06:46:24] Krishnan: am fiddling around with it more to understand better :) This is interesting :D
[2013-07-26 06:57:06] Krishnan: Graham
[2013-07-26 06:57:45] Krishnan: how do I instruct iOSDriver to ignore cert errors ?
[2013-07-26 06:57:47] Krishnan: for a webpage
[2013-07-26 07:05:37] Krishnan: ok.. that was a stupid question :) Please ignore it
[2013-07-26 07:22:12] nicegraham: Krishnan: I assume you figured it out - but from memory there's away to tell mobile safari to accept all certs but I can't remember exaclty how
[2013-07-26 07:22:21] smccarthy, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-07-26 07:22:56] Krishnan: I tried using a dc.setCapability(CapabilityType.ACCEPT_SSL_CERTS, true); but it doesnt seem to be doing the trick.. maybe coz my test site has an expired certificate apart from it being invalid :)
[2013-07-26 07:23:05] Krishnan: I am guessing that this might be the reason..
[2013-07-26 07:23:32] nicegraham: not sure - if nirvdrum is on later I think he knows the answer [it would be good to document it :)]
[2013-07-26 07:24:01] nicegraham: :note nirvdrum how do you tell mobile safari to accept all certs?
[2013-07-26 07:27:40] Krishnan: nicegraham : Would I be allowed to spawn multiple simulators on the same mac, or am I to stick to 1 simulator per mac setup ?
[2013-07-26 07:28:02] nicegraham: only one simulator can run per desktop
[2013-07-26 07:28:13] nicegraham: we get around that by running multiple mac vms on each machine
[2013-07-26 07:28:23] nicegraham: we use vmware fusion to achieve that
[2013-07-26 07:28:38] nicegraham: the limit is one with apple/xcode/the simulator
[2013-07-26 07:29:01] Krishnan: oh.. is there any link that can show me how do I do that ? I would love to try that.. I mean the vmware fusion.. [Sorry if that sounded like a basic question though ]
[2013-07-26 07:29:02] nicegraham: there is hope that we'll be able to remove that limitation in the future but it's not availabe yet
[2013-07-26 07:29:32] nicegraham: we just run the client from here http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/overview.html
[2013-07-26 07:29:44] nicegraham: there's a 30 day trial but after that you have to pay
[2013-07-26 07:29:49] nicegraham: but it's not significant
[2013-07-26 07:29:56] nicegraham: then you just need the mac osx image
[2013-07-26 07:30:01] nicegraham: and do the install
[2013-07-26 07:30:13] nicegraham: once you create one image you can reuse it
[2013-07-26 07:30:35] Krishnan: Oh ok.. now I need to figure out how do I get the Mac OSX image :) I only have a MAC at my disposal though
[2013-07-26 07:30:59] nicegraham: well you can get it from the app store for $20
[2013-07-26 07:31:03] nicegraham: that's what we did :)
[2013-07-26 07:31:34] Krishnan: nicegraham: 20 USD and its available eh ? Wow... That kinda answers a lot of questions
[2013-07-26 07:32:27] nicegraham: yeah, just search in the app store
[2013-07-26 07:32:33] nicegraham: it's 17.99 euro for me
[2013-07-26 07:32:48] Krishnan: Doing it right now...:)
[2013-07-26 07:32:51] nicegraham: https://itunes.apple.com/ie/app/os-x-mountain-lion/id537386512?mt=12
[2013-07-26 07:33:10] Krishnan: Lol.. It looked as if u read my mind :D i was gonna ask that next... can u give me the link :p
[2013-07-26 07:41:29] Krishnan: nicegraham: A few more questions.. w.r.t iOSDriver and Grid... for me to use iOSDriver+Grid, should I have to use the IOSRemoteProxy ?
[2013-07-26 07:45:42] nicegraham: no you don't need to
[2013-07-26 07:46:07] Krishnan: If I dont use it when I register the node to the Grid.. I see this :
[2013-07-26 07:46:09] Krishnan: org.openqa.selenium.WebDriverException: Error forwarding the new session cannot find : {acceptSslCerts=true, simulator=true, timeHack=false, variation=Regular, locale=en_GB, CFBundleName=Safari, device=iphone, language=en}
[2013-07-26 07:46:23] Krishnan: which I know is Grid's way of telling me, it can find what I need
[2013-07-26 07:46:38] Krishnan: IOSCapabilities dc = IOSCapabilities.iphone("Safari"); <-- This is how am instantiating the capabilities
[2013-07-26 07:47:08] Krishnan: perhaps the .iphone() is adding up a few more goodies to my capabilities request which is not matching with what the node has ?
[2013-07-26 07:47:50] nicegraham: no, that should work I believe
[2013-07-26 07:48:05] nicegraham: that's basically what lukeis demoed at seconf
[2013-07-26 07:48:26] nicegraham: https://github.com/lukeis/seconf
[2013-07-26 07:48:51] nicegraham: https://github.com/lukeis/seconf/blob/master/src/main/java/me/lukeis/example/drivers/MobileSafariIPhoneDriver.java
[2013-07-26 07:50:15] nicegraham: can you see the node on grid?
[2013-07-26 07:50:31] Krishnan: Yeah I can.. but it doesnt list me the capabilities of the browser at all
[2013-07-26 07:50:55] Krishnan: wd/hub/capabilities/all <-- loading this on the node shows the capabilities though
[2013-07-26 07:51:05] nicegraham: yeah, that's ok
[2013-07-26 07:51:26] nicegraham: the default remote proxy may not know how to display them
[2013-07-26 07:51:37] nicegraham: I can't remember at this point :)
[2013-07-26 07:53:40] Krishnan: nicegraham: Luke seems to be referring to this end point : "http://localhost:3001/wd/hub" <-- thats not the default grid's end-point is it ?
[2013-07-26 07:54:21] Krishnan: rwd = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://localhost:4444/wd/hub"), DesiredCapabilities.iphone()); <-- This is how am doing it... This works if I use the IOSRemoteProxy as my proxy when am hooking on the node.. But it conks when I take out IOSRemoteProxy out of the picture
[2013-07-26 08:01:12] nicegraham: yeah, there's a registration request to the specified hub
[2013-07-26 08:01:17] nicegraham: but that doesn't seem to be firing...
[2013-07-26 08:01:28] nicegraham: I think some code was lost in a merge
[2013-07-26 08:01:33] nicegraham: I'll look at it this evening
[2013-07-26 08:02:39] Krishnan: oh ok...
[2013-07-26 08:03:40] Krishnan: Just to let you know.. I am running selenium-server-standalone-2.33.0.jar on the Grid side... and on the node side I am running ios-server-0.6.0.jar that I downloaded from the github gh-page portal
[2013-07-26 08:04:54] Krishnan: Should I be putting in this one as a bug on the github page ?
[2013-07-26 08:07:59] nicegraham: actually, this is stuff I added post-0.6.0
[2013-07-26 08:08:09] Krishnan: ah..
[2013-07-26 08:08:16] Krishnan: so does it mean am doing something wrong perhaps ?
[2013-07-26 08:08:16] nicegraham: in that code base, registration only works if your use teh iosremoteproxy
[2013-07-26 08:08:37] nicegraham: otherwise you'd need to send the registration req yourself
[2013-07-26 08:08:46] nicegraham: using flynnid or something like that
[2013-07-26 08:09:01] Krishnan: u mean before ur code change or after ur code change ?
[2013-07-26 08:09:11] nicegraham: in 0.6.0
[2013-07-26 08:09:36] Krishnan: ah ok ! So what I figured out was true :) That the proxy is required for the iosDriver to work with the Grid.. :)
[2013-07-26 08:10:37] nicegraham: in 0.6.0
[2013-07-26 08:10:43] Krishnan: Is this changing in the newer version ?
[2013-07-26 08:10:44] nicegraham: but that was poor planning by me
[2013-07-26 08:10:47] nicegraham: yes
[2013-07-26 08:10:55] Krishnan: :) oh ok.
[2013-07-26 08:11:06] nicegraham: in the latest code base what was happening was that if you specify a hub it will send the reg request
[2013-07-26 08:11:41] nicegraham: iosremoteproxy extends that by continuing to poll so any updated caps get picked up
[2013-07-26 08:11:58] nicegraham: for example a new app is delivered by CI to your ios-driver instance
[2013-07-26 08:13:26] Krishnan: yeah I read that.. which was why I was confused.. coz reading the docs kinda gave me an impression that the IOSRemoteProxy would be required only if am dealing with apps specifically
[2013-07-26 08:13:27] nicegraham: i'll figure this out later and push a fix
[2013-07-26 08:13:37] nicegraham: well it is
[2013-07-26 08:13:51] Krishnan: but if I were to be using IOSDriver for automation on Safari..i dont need to be using the IOSRemoteProxy
[2013-07-26 08:13:55] nicegraham: if your caps will never change then you don't need to poll for those changes
[2013-07-26 08:14:02] Krishnan: but when i was finding the net results different, I was kinda confused
[2013-07-26 08:14:51] Krishnan: got that.. so in those circumstances there is no point in me even using the IOSRemoteProxy right.. that is if I dont need the polling part
