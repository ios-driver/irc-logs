[2013-07-23 01:16:45] nicegraham: wondering if you'd had a chance to look at that bug we have with large pages? or any ideas on what the cause might be?
[2013-07-23 01:32:41] freynaud: no yet
[2013-07-23 01:32:52] freynaud: i worked on #63 yesterday
[2013-07-23 01:33:22] freynaud: I'll do the language one today; Picking the locale algorithm is wrong

[2013-07-23 02:18:45] freynaud: I keep being disconnected, this is annoying
[2013-07-23 02:22:11] freynaud: have you tried ios7 ?
[2013-07-23 02:22:19] freynaud: I think safari behaves differentrly
[2013-07-23 02:23:50] nicegraham: no, not yet
[2013-07-23 02:24:05] nicegraham: I downloaded xcode and it caused havoc
[2013-07-23 02:24:08] nicegraham: so I deleted it again
[2013-07-23 02:31:28] freynaud: you can keep both
[2013-07-23 02:31:35] freynaud: and switch with xcode-select
[2013-07-23 02:31:46] freynaud: keep the installed of the new xcode
[2013-07-23 02:32:00] freynaud: safari gets delete by ios driver I think :)
[2013-07-23 02:32:53] nicegraham: in ios7?
[2013-07-23 02:33:43] nicegraham: ha, apple dev center is still down!
[2013-07-23 02:35:42] freynaud: yes, they had a leak of user data and they turned it off
[2013-07-23 02:36:21] nicegraham: yeah, I thought they were back by now though
[2013-07-23 02:36:42] nicegraham: read it was a security dude who wanted to prove how far the vulnerability went
[2013-07-23 02:36:49] nicegraham: he found 13 bugs or something like that
[2013-07-23 02:36:52] nicegraham: and informed apple
[2013-07-23 02:37:52] nicegraham: http://www.engadget.com/2013/07/22/turkish-researcher-apple-hack/
[2013-07-23 02:42:28] nicegraham: what's the problem with the locale and lang selection?
[2013-07-23 02:45:58] freynaud: the current implementation is wrong
[2013-07-23 02:46:18] freynaud: the language folder loaded is a combination of language + locale
[2013-07-23 02:46:29] freynaud: if you select english for instance
[2013-07-23 02:46:34] freynaud: and you're in japan
[2013-07-23 02:46:56] freynaud: it should load en_JP if it exist, then default to en
[2013-07-23 02:47:13] freynaud: atm, it doesn't consider the locale
[2013-07-23 02:47:28] nicegraham: ok, so it defaults for the en native locale

[2013-07-23 03:05:56] operatiay: Hey, guys. Is anyone of you using TestNG to execute the tests? We've got a problem there... was hoping that someone could help to figure out the reason behind it...
[2013-07-23 03:52:58] nicegraham: hi operatiay
[2013-07-23 03:53:08] nicegraham: yeah, we use testng to run the tests
[2013-07-23 04:06:36] operatiay: :) thanks. We've figured out that our TestListener was the problem, why we didn't get any information back to the TestNG. so there's no issue left
[2013-07-23 05:12:05] nicegraham: freynaud: are you finished the inspector updates?
[2013-07-23 05:12:38] nicegraham: or is it stable for us to try it?
[2013-07-23 05:19:48] brian__, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-07-23 05:25:53] freynaud: you can try it as long as you don't do landscape I think
[2013-07-23 05:30:16] nicegraham: ok cool, I'll pull it down
[2013-07-23 05:31:23] AutomatedTester: freynaud: hey, can you chime in one the Mobile JSON Wire mailing list about meeting up on August 19
[2013-07-23 05:31:28] AutomatedTester: so we can see if it works for you?
[2013-07-23 05:36:29] freynaud: done.
[2013-07-23 05:36:34] freynaud: it _should_ work
[2013-07-23 05:36:49] AutomatedTester: cool
[2013-07-23 05:37:00] freynaud: i'm not too sure what my agenda looks like for august. At some point I'd like to see the family :)
[2013-07-23 05:38:57] AutomatedTester: freynaud: family break in London?
[2013-07-23 05:39:02] AutomatedTester: your home away from home
[2013-07-23 05:40:47] freynaud: family in on vacation in France, and I'm in Zurich
[2013-07-23 05:40:59] freynaud: home is Zurich now
[2013-07-23 05:50:53] nicegraham: freynaud: very few conflicts with dev on that brnach ;)

[2013-07-23 09:45:49] apailthorp: Seeking guidance on getting IOSCapabilities for Java via Maven - total newb. Exists in a repository I can reference via pom.xml?
[2013-07-23 09:46:47] lukeis: not yet‚Ä¶.
[2013-07-23 09:47:00] lukeis: it may be a little while
[2013-07-23 09:47:22] lukeis: workaround in maven is to include the jar locally and use <system>
[2013-07-23 09:47:26] apailthorp: So sad. Best way to push it to a local repository myself so I can run my code from multiple machines..
[2013-07-23 09:47:27] apailthorp: yes
[2013-07-23 09:48:00] apailthorp: newb ? How to do above - links greatly appreciated, don't want to learn much about Maven if I can help it...
[2013-07-23 09:49:44] lukeis: http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#System_Dependencies
[2013-07-23 09:50:22] apailthorp: Awesomeness! Soon will find my uncle Bob. Gratitude abounds.
[2013-07-23 09:50:22] lukeis: although this is a less than ideal approach, system scope has many problems, but if you're using it for testing it shouldn't be a problem
[2013-07-23 09:50:33] apailthorp: k
[2013-07-23 10:05:13] nicegraham: lukeis: what is the process to get it into a public repo?
[2013-07-23 10:05:27] nicegraham: is it something I can get going?
[2013-07-23 10:06:32] lukeis: nicegraham: yeah, you can follows these instructions (step by step) - https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide
[2013-07-23 10:06:58] lukeis: when you get to the point of logging a ticket with them, please include me in the permissions to push. my username there is lsemerau
[2013-07-23 10:07:13] nicegraham: cool, I'll get that going
[2013-07-23 10:07:15] nicegraham: will do
[2013-07-23 10:13:10] nicegraham: lukeis: freynaud owns org.uiautomation right?
[2013-07-23 10:13:19] lukeis: i dunno :)
[2013-07-23 10:13:34] lukeis: looks like
[2013-07-23 10:13:37] nicegraham: I thought he said he did...
[2013-07-23 10:13:42] nicegraham: I'll see if it's listed
[2013-07-23 10:14:17] nicegraham: well,it redirects to our wiki - so it's a good bet :)
