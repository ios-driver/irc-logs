[2013-07-25 04:49:58] freynaud: where are the NSLog written for simulator
[2013-07-25 04:50:09] freynaud: there is a file somewhere, I can't find it anymore :)
[2013-07-25 04:56:35] nicegraham: it writes it to file?
[2013-07-25 04:56:39] nicegraham: or the handler?
[2013-07-25 04:58:31] freynaud: the stuff you see in in the organizer, Console of your device
[2013-07-25 04:58:34] freynaud: i need that for sim
[2013-07-25 04:59:32] nicegraham: it gets written to ios-driver.log doesn't it?
[2013-07-25 04:59:52] nicegraham: in the root folder
[2013-07-25 05:05:25] freynaud: no
[2013-07-25 05:05:32] freynaud: you're talking about ios driver logs
[2013-07-25 05:05:41] freynaud: I'm talking about the logs of the app under test
[2013-07-25 05:05:46] freynaud: nothing to do with ios driver
[2013-07-25 05:13:03] nicegraham: oh, sorry
[2013-07-25 05:13:49] nicegraham: apparently it goes here /var/log/system.log

[2013-07-25 05:21:56] freynaud: on the real device, for my app I have some files like StdErr_07-25-13 14-02-24.log
[2013-07-25 05:22:07] freynaud: that's what I'd like to access for sim
[2013-07-25 05:22:12] freynaud: ideally real time
[2013-07-25 05:24:13] nicegraham: i opened console app and then I opened simulator and started browsing in safari
[2013-07-25 05:24:17] nicegraham: I saw messages coming in
[2013-07-25 05:24:24] nicegraham: is that not enough?
[2013-07-25 05:24:40] nicegraham: it seems like the simulator writes to sysout
[2013-07-25 05:24:47] nicegraham: so it should all be available
[2013-07-25 05:26:44] nicegraham: this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1864479/crash-logs-generated-by-iphone-simulator
