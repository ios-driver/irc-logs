[2013-07-31 02:49:15] freynaud: a lot of code is obsolete

[2013-07-31 04:59:51] freynaud: but i'd be more confortable, you know, having a test :)
[2013-07-31 05:00:05] nicegraham: any idea why a table contents would not be in order in the treeview?

[2013-07-31 05:44:17] freynaud: nicegraham: did it autoscroll before ?

[2013-07-31 05:44:45] freynaud: should it ?
[2013-07-31 05:44:52] nicegraham: it just highlighted the node off screen and put the details in the panel
[2013-07-31 05:44:54] nicegraham: I think so
[2013-07-31 05:45:00] freynaud: if you mouse over and it keeps scrolling super fast, it will be annoying
[2013-07-31 05:45:12] nicegraham: it's highlighting something you can't see
[2013-07-31 05:45:27] freynaud: i'm moving a lot of files around

[2013-07-31 05:45:36] nicegraham: ok
[2013-07-31 05:45:36] nicegraham: that's it
[2013-07-31 05:45:44] nicegraham: just the ide.js and .css
[2013-07-31 05:46:20] nicegraham: it does scroll fast but only when you're interacting with the mouse over - I think it makes sense tbh

[2013-07-31 06:38:59] nicegraham: ok, cool
[2013-07-31 06:39:09] nicegraham: so that's like the new dev branch I guess?
[2013-07-31 06:39:46] freynaud: I'm runing the tests, merging dev to it, and if everything still pass, I'll merge cleanup to dev, and start working on a new jna_impl or something like that
[2013-07-31 06:40:42] nicegraham: ok, sounds like a plan!
[2013-07-31 06:40:55] nicegraham: I added a new version of our app which has a crash me button

[2013-07-31 07:05:42] freynaud: wkrdp is asyncronous
[2013-07-31 07:06:03] freynaud: so there should be a timeout waiting for the response, but nothing bad
[2013-07-31 07:06:45] nicegraham: I hoped something would be in WebKitNotificationListener
[2013-07-31 07:06:49] nicegraham: but it doesn't seem to be
[2013-07-31 07:08:37] freynaud: that's only for web
[2013-07-31 07:09:09] freynaud: all the web stuff is asyncronous, so crash = you'll stop receive messages, not exceptions
[2013-07-31 07:09:21] freynaud: what will probably crash is UIAScriptServlet
[2013-07-31 07:09:31] freynaud: that keeps a socket open to instruments
[2013-07-31 07:09:59] freynaud: app crash = instruments stops = socket closed exception somewhere in that servlet I suspect

[2013-07-31 08:08:48] freynaud: web
[2013-07-31 08:08:55] freynaud: native I have 3 failures
[2013-07-31 08:09:09] freynaud: which I caused with my refactoring
[2013-07-31 08:09:19] freynaud: I'll fix them
[2013-07-31 08:09:27] nicegraham: ok
[2013-07-31 08:09:30] nicegraham: I'm running again now
[2013-07-31 08:10:44] nicegraham: I get that Caused by: org.json.JSONException: JSONObject["using"] not found. exception but the tests pass in the IDE anyway
[2013-07-31 08:11:12] nicegraham: that exception is being caused trying to find the keyboard
[2013-07-31 08:11:24] nicegraham: which the tests aren't doing so I assume it's a default check?
[2013-07-31 08:11:25] freynaud: i have it too
[2013-07-31 08:11:33] freynaud: I'll clean it up
[2013-07-31 08:11:44] nicegraham: is that causing the fails for you though?
[2013-07-31 08:11:49] nicegraham: the tests are passing for me
[2013-07-31 08:12:02] freynaud: I still have plenty of cleanup to do, but at least the landscape mode is ok now
[2013-07-31 08:12:14] freynaud: no idea, I haven't investigated
