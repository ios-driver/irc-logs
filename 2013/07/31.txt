[2013-07-31 02:48:52] freynaud: et voila.
[2013-07-31 02:49:09] freynaud: nicegraham: it still need a good cleanup
[2013-07-31 02:49:15] freynaud: a lot of code is obsolete
[2013-07-31 02:49:25] freynaud: but the functionality should work

[2013-07-31 03:15:09] nicegraham: freynaud: excellent!
[2013-07-31 03:20:00] nicegraham: freynaud: how can we release the new inspector as 0.6.2? :)
[2013-07-31 03:20:08] nicegraham: ^it looks great btw

[2013-07-31 04:31:22] freynaud: i haven't tested portrait_upside_down as I don't have an app supporting it

[2013-07-31 04:58:58] *nicegraham ok, we don't have one either - our main app is locked to portrait'
[2013-07-31 04:59:36] freynaud: it should be ok
[2013-07-31 04:59:51] freynaud: but i'd be more confortable, you know, having a test :)
[2013-07-31 05:00:05] nicegraham: any idea why a table contents would not be in order in the treeview?
[2013-07-31 05:00:25] nicegraham: that's just a representation of the logElementTree response right?

[2013-07-31 05:16:26] freynaud: yes
[2013-07-31 05:16:47] freynaud: they should be in order according to the id
[2013-07-31 05:17:03] freynaud: the the order I get from Instruments

[2013-07-31 05:44:17] freynaud: nicegraham: did it autoscroll before ?
[2013-07-31 05:44:26] nicegraham: no
[2013-07-31 05:44:45] freynaud: should it ?
[2013-07-31 05:44:52] nicegraham: it just highlighted the node off screen and put the details in the panel
[2013-07-31 05:44:54] nicegraham: I think so
[2013-07-31 05:45:00] freynaud: if you mouse over and it keeps scrolling super fast, it will be annoying
[2013-07-31 05:45:12] nicegraham: it's highlighting something you can't see
[2013-07-31 05:45:27] freynaud: i'm moving a lot of files around
[2013-07-31 05:45:30] freynaud: don't commit to much please, or i'll have to merge :)
[2013-07-31 05:45:36] nicegraham: ok
[2013-07-31 05:45:36] nicegraham: that's it
[2013-07-31 05:45:44] nicegraham: just the ide.js and .css
[2013-07-31 05:46:20] nicegraham: it does scroll fast but only when you're interacting with the mouse over - I think it makes sense tbh
