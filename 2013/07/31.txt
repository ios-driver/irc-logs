[2013-07-31 04:31:01] freynaud: ask them to start filing bugs if they see wrong stuff
[2013-07-31 04:31:22] freynaud: i haven't tested portrait_upside_down as I don't have an app supporting it
[2013-07-31 04:56:33] admc, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-07-31 04:58:58] *nicegraham ok, we don't have one either - our main app is locked to portrait'
[2013-07-31 04:59:36] freynaud: it should be ok
[2013-07-31 04:59:51] freynaud: but i'd be more confortable, you know, having a test :)
[2013-07-31 05:00:05] nicegraham: any idea why a table contents would not be in order in the treeview?
[2013-07-31 05:00:25] nicegraham: that's just a representation of the logElementTree response right?

[2013-07-31 05:16:26] freynaud: yes
[2013-07-31 05:16:47] freynaud: they should be in order according to the id
[2013-07-31 05:17:03] freynaud: the the order I get from Instruments
