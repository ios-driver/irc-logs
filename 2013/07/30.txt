[2013-07-30 03:25:00] operatiay: freynaud_: native
[2013-07-30 03:25:25] freynaud_: and it's not in one of the attribute ?
[2013-07-30 03:25:32] freynaud_: label,name,value
[2013-07-30 03:25:40] operatiay: no, it's in the attribute image
[2013-07-30 03:25:50] operatiay: that's how it is set programmatically
[2013-07-30 03:26:29] freynaud_: your dev will have to set it to one of the attribute that instruments sees too
[2013-07-30 03:26:35] freynaud_: label,  value or name
[2013-07-30 03:26:41] operatiay: it is not displayed in the inspector and we cannot access it... is there a way to add some attributes to the supported ones?
[2013-07-30 03:26:44] freynaud_: there is no way to check anything else
[2013-07-30 03:26:59] operatiay: ok, i see. thanks
[2013-07-30 03:27:04] freynaud_: there is. You need to apply for a job @ Apple, and change instruments :)
[2013-07-30 03:27:14] operatiay: :) an interesting idea
[2013-07-30 03:27:49] operatiay: did you try applying @ Apple?
[2013-07-30 03:28:22] operatiay: :) I'm merely a java developer, so no chance to get into there
[2013-07-30 03:34:42] freynaud_: i haven't

[2013-07-30 13:03:54] freynaud_: it's not supported yet
[2013-07-30 13:04:05] freynaud_: can you file a bug to track the issue ?
[2013-07-30 13:05:58] freynaud_: python has nothing to do with it btw, it's handled server side
[2013-07-30 13:06:21] nicegraham: I thought nirvdrum was able to get around this?
[2013-07-30 13:06:33] freynaud_: there are work around
[2013-07-30 13:06:39] freynaud_: but not implemented yet i think
[2013-07-30 13:06:50] freynaud_: it's not super hard to fix
[2013-07-30 13:07:06] freynaud_: instead of using the wkrdp protocol to load a url, use JS
[2013-07-30 13:07:23] freynaud_: the wkrdp protocol just gnome calls with wrong ssl
[2013-07-30 13:07:40] freynaud_: when you do that, you have the popup saying the ssl is wrong
[2013-07-30 13:07:49] freynaud_: switch to native, click it, done
[2013-07-30 13:08:04] freynaud_: but it's still ugly
[2013-07-30 13:08:29] freynaud_: i don't know what happens if you have some wrong include for some js/css include from different domain
[2013-07-30 13:08:33] freynaud_: might not popup
[2013-07-30 13:08:49] freynaud_: in any case, people should by certificate for their QA envt

[2013-07-30 13:54:29] nicegraham: this is the latest build [it doesn't support real devices and you'll need to add -simulators to the command line to enable simulators] https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/releases/download/0.6.1/ios-server-0.6.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar
[2013-07-30 13:54:48] mgaradi: I am using 0.6.1..does that have it already?
[2013-07-30 13:55:04] nicegraham: hmm, it should
[2013-07-30 13:56:09] nicegraham: what version of grid are you running?
[2013-07-30 13:57:19] mgaradi: 2.33.0

[2013-07-30 13:57:35] nicegraham: we haven't seen that error in the latest code
[2013-07-30 13:57:44] nicegraham: I'll need to speak to a colleague tomorrow
[2013-07-30 13:57:55] nicegraham: I think we'll have to add some debug in and get you to run that
[2013-07-30 13:58:07] mgaradi: okay
[2013-07-30 13:58:09] nicegraham: it's very difficult to diagnose this issue because it's intermittent
[2013-07-30 13:58:17] mgaradi: yeah
[2013-07-30 13:58:29] nicegraham: but we've already been through it
[2013-07-30 13:58:39] mgaradi: can you give me the options how you started the grid and ios-driver?
[2013-07-30 13:58:48] mgaradi: that may help me see and compare how I do it
[2013-07-30 13:59:17] nicegraham: it's pretty much this https://gist.github.com/nicegraham/7185267a6d2d326afaaa
[2013-07-30 13:59:40] nicegraham: I think we have timeout params set in our production grid
[2013-07-30 14:14:46] mgaradi: The grid shows capabilities with 2 IOS Simulators
[2013-07-30 14:15:02] mgaradi: is that the reason why the session forward fails?
[2013-07-30 14:15:44] mgaradi: I mean when one simulator is in use the webdriver is thinking there is another simulator on the same machine and tries to forward a request to it?
[2013-07-30 14:16:11] mgaradi: I could reproduce it that way by kicking off the two tests with only one node attached to a hub
[2013-07-30 14:16:18] mgaradi: and it threw me out with same error
