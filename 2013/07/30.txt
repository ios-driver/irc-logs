[2013-07-30 02:45:48] operatiay: we want to verify that the referenced image is a specific one (we know basically, which value to expect there, but cannot read it)

[2013-07-30 03:22:30] freynaud_: operatiay: web or native ?
[2013-07-30 03:25:00] operatiay: freynaud_: native
[2013-07-30 03:25:25] freynaud_: and it's not in one of the attribute ?
[2013-07-30 03:25:32] freynaud_: label,name,value
[2013-07-30 03:25:40] operatiay: no, it's in the attribute image
[2013-07-30 03:25:50] operatiay: that's how it is set programmatically
[2013-07-30 03:26:29] freynaud_: your dev will have to set it to one of the attribute that instruments sees too
[2013-07-30 03:26:35] freynaud_: label,  value or name
[2013-07-30 03:26:41] operatiay: it is not displayed in the inspector and we cannot access it... is there a way to add some attributes to the supported ones?
[2013-07-30 03:26:44] freynaud_: there is no way to check anything else
[2013-07-30 03:26:59] operatiay: ok, i see. thanks
[2013-07-30 03:27:04] freynaud_: there is. You need to apply for a job @ Apple, and change instruments :)
[2013-07-30 03:27:14] operatiay: :) an interesting idea
[2013-07-30 03:27:49] operatiay: did you try applying @ Apple?
[2013-07-30 03:28:22] operatiay: :) I'm merely a java developer, so no chance to get into there
[2013-07-30 03:34:42] freynaud_: i haven't
[2013-07-30 03:34:53] freynaud_: i'm happy where I am :)
[2013-07-30 03:35:12] operatiay: ebay France? :)
[2013-07-30 03:35:42] freynaud_: i started there, then move to the uk, now I'm in switzerland.
[2013-07-30 03:36:25] operatiay: nice... :) i've done only half of your way till now
