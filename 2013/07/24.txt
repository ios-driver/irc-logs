[2013-07-24 01:37:33] nicegraham: should I try and push 0.6.0 to maven? or wait for 0.7.0 - and if so what sort of release date do you think is doable?
[2013-07-24 01:48:00] freynaud: sure, go for it
[2013-07-24 01:48:12] freynaud: 0.7 I still don't really know
[2013-07-24 01:48:26] freynaud: I'm fixing the bugs, but some require more time than anticipated
[2013-07-24 01:57:09] nicegraham: ok, I'll try and get the uploaded today

[2013-07-24 05:27:04] freynaud: no, I removed the JNI dependency entirely
[2013-07-24 05:27:18] freynaud: I run the tests on simulator without the -beta flag
[2013-07-24 05:27:54] nicegraham: ok, I removed beta and see the fails
[2013-07-24 05:28:03] nicegraham: not sure what's changed...

[2013-07-24 05:28:54] freynaud: JNI -> JNA starts now.
[2013-07-24 05:29:36] nicegraham: so the native flick tests pass, it's just the web ones

[2013-07-24 05:39:29] ags: Finally.. My office network is hiccuping me out of here a bit.
[2013-07-24 05:39:36] nicegraham: :)
[2013-07-24 05:40:48] nicegraham: I see the maven repo is created, so we just need to push a jar up now
[2013-07-24 05:40:55] ags: So, I got "access" to maven.org. I'd like to release v0.6 into there.
[2013-07-24 05:41:09] nicegraham: yeah, that sounds good
[2013-07-24 05:41:20] nicegraham: I had a go this morning
[2013-07-24 05:41:28] nicegraham: but I was hitting all sorts of problems
[2013-07-24 05:41:45] nicegraham: I've never had to do it before
[2013-07-24 05:41:53] nicegraham: so that made it more complicated
[2013-07-24 05:42:15] nicegraham: I think I've now got all the pre-requisites in place
[2013-07-24 05:42:21] nicegraham: and I added the missing bits to the pom
[2013-07-24 05:42:36] nicegraham: but when I start the deploy process its giving me errors

[2013-07-24 07:10:03] operatiay: by the way, we've managed to solve the problem: when the IOSRemoteProxy is not used, the forwarding based on the browser name is working fine.
[2013-07-24 07:10:43] nicegraham: that proxy uses the same capability matcher
[2013-07-24 07:10:53] nicegraham: there's no different logic in that part
[2013-07-24 07:11:13] operatiay: but it's working without the proxy...
[2013-07-24 07:11:15] nicegraham: unless the registration is not including some propety
[2013-07-24 07:11:54] nicegraham: it's hard to know without being able to debug the capabilties on the hub
[2013-07-24 07:15:13] operatiay: true... I've never debugged the hub... how can I do it?
[2013-07-24 07:16:22] nicegraham: here's an example https://github.com/nicegraham/selenium-grid2-api/blob/master/src/main/java/com/seleniumgrid2api/StartGrid.java
[2013-07-24 07:18:22] operatiay: I was hoping for something like connecting to a debug port...
[2013-07-24 07:18:51] nicegraham: haha
[2013-07-24 07:19:03] operatiay: :) am I expecting too  much?
[2013-07-24 07:19:11] nicegraham: yep :)
[2013-07-24 07:20:06] nicegraham: by debugin like that - you can breakpoint in the hub and see what it's being asked for versus what it has registered.
[2013-07-24 07:20:24] freynaud: you can remotly debug
[2013-07-24 07:20:26] freynaud: or local
[2013-07-24 07:20:33] freynaud: it's a java process, nothing special
[2013-07-24 07:21:27] operatiay: so what can I do after I've started this process locally? do I have to start it in debug mode?
[2013-07-24 07:22:14] freynaud: yes, or start it from your prefered IDE
[2013-07-24 07:23:03] operatiay: but I cannot connect to the already running hub... can I?
[2013-07-24 07:26:36] *nicegraham not that I know of - that's not how I do it at least'
[2013-07-24 07:27:05] freynaud: you need to start the hub with the java debug flags to use remote debuging
[2013-07-24 07:29:19] operatiay: thanks, guys. I'll investigate it further in my leisure time :)

[2013-07-24 07:43:12] freynaud: i'll update the message
[2013-07-24 07:43:26] freynaud: maybe your devs know actually
[2013-07-24 07:43:42] freynaud: in xcode, when you work on localization, you can select the "normal" languages
[2013-07-24 07:43:51] freynaud: like english, french etc.
[2013-07-24 07:44:13] freynaud: then you have the "others", like en-CA or fr-CA
[2013-07-24 07:44:32] freynaud: i can create those, I see them in the project and the app, but they're never used
[2013-07-24 07:45:01] nicegraham: what do you mean never used? the app never reads from them?
[2013-07-24 07:45:21] freynaud: if I select english as a language, and canada as a region ,I still get the content from the english folder. Not from the en-CA folder
[2013-07-24 07:45:56] freynaud: the app doesn't use them
[2013-07-24 07:45:59] nicegraham: ok, that sounds like a bug to me :) I'll ask if they've come across that before
[2013-07-24 07:46:06] freynaud: not sure it's a bug
[2013-07-24 07:46:25] freynaud: if you use afrikaans from instance, it's not even a recognize language by apple
[2013-07-24 07:46:34] freynaud: so it might be there for dev to manually read
[2013-07-24 07:47:15] freynaud: and those file shouldn't be parsed by ios-driver then, ad the parsing isn't standard, and each dev team could do different things
[2013-07-24 07:49:13] nicegraham: I asked the guys here - one chap has a vague recollection of that. He thinks it's somehow related to the registered country but he's not sure
[2013-07-24 07:49:17] nicegraham: [and not much help]
[2013-07-24 07:49:28] nicegraham: he did say there's loads of quirks like that
[2013-07-24 07:50:42] nicegraham: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3308519/iphone-app-localization-english-problems
[2013-07-24 07:53:12] nicegraham: from apple: Therefore if your project includes language-specific project directories with both a language and region designator, those directories are ignored.
