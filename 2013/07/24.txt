[2013-07-24 01:36:45] nicegraham: morning freynaud
[2013-07-24 01:37:33] nicegraham: should I try and push 0.6.0 to maven? or wait for 0.7.0 - and if so what sort of release date do you think is doable?
[2013-07-24 01:48:00] freynaud: sure, go for it
[2013-07-24 01:48:12] freynaud: 0.7 I still don't really know
[2013-07-24 01:48:26] freynaud: I'm fixing the bugs, but some require more time than anticipated
[2013-07-24 01:57:09] nicegraham: ok, I'll try and get the uploaded today
[2013-07-24 01:57:30] nicegraham: I had a quick go this morning and it's fairly complicated - or I'm missing some config
[2013-07-24 01:57:42] nicegraham: I'm hoping lukeis will be able to provide guidance maybe
[2013-07-24 01:57:49] nicegraham: or the guy who created the repo :)

[2013-07-24 04:34:15] operatiay: sorry guys, can anyone help me with the correct parameters needed to configure the webdriver in order to execute tests on simulated safari with simulator supporting app testing as well?
[2013-07-24 04:37:45] freynaud: if you're using 0.6 there is no need to have extra params
[2013-07-24 04:38:19] freynaud: safari is added by default as a supported app. You just need to specify where you own apps are and both will be available
[2013-07-24 04:41:59] freynaud: nicegraham:I have all the flick tests failing
[2013-07-24 04:42:08] freynaud: did you run them recently
[2013-07-24 04:44:31] operatiay: i'm using 0.7
[2013-07-24 04:44:37] nicegraham: no, I'll have a look
