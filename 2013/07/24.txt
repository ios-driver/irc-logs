[2013-07-24 01:36:45] nicegraham: morning freynaud
[2013-07-24 01:37:33] nicegraham: should I try and push 0.6.0 to maven? or wait for 0.7.0 - and if so what sort of release date do you think is doable?
[2013-07-24 01:48:00] freynaud: sure, go for it
[2013-07-24 01:48:12] freynaud: 0.7 I still don't really know
[2013-07-24 01:48:26] freynaud: I'm fixing the bugs, but some require more time than anticipated
[2013-07-24 01:57:09] nicegraham: ok, I'll try and get the uploaded today
[2013-07-24 01:57:30] nicegraham: I had a quick go this morning and it's fairly complicated - or I'm missing some config
[2013-07-24 01:57:42] nicegraham: I'm hoping lukeis will be able to provide guidance maybe
[2013-07-24 01:57:49] nicegraham: or the guy who created the repo :)

[2013-07-24 04:37:45] freynaud: if you're using 0.6 there is no need to have extra params
[2013-07-24 04:38:19] freynaud: safari is added by default as a supported app. You just need to specify where you own apps are and both will be available
[2013-07-24 04:41:59] freynaud: nicegraham:I have all the flick tests failing
[2013-07-24 04:42:08] freynaud: did you run them recently
[2013-07-24 04:44:31] operatiay: i'm using 0.7
[2013-07-24 04:44:37] nicegraham: no, I'll have a look
[2013-07-24 04:56:03] operatiay: nicegraham: I am experiencing difficulties with the grid server correctly identifying the capabilities for the ios-node... especially the browserName parameter "IOS Simulator" results in waiting job, although the ios-hub is registered

[2013-07-24 05:26:20] nicegraham: freynaud: running those tests - I hit a jni image error, is that what you're seeing? or do the tests actually try to run?
[2013-07-24 05:27:04] freynaud: no, I removed the JNI dependency entirely
[2013-07-24 05:27:18] freynaud: I run the tests on simulator without the -beta flag
[2013-07-24 05:27:54] nicegraham: ok, I removed beta and see the fails
[2013-07-24 05:28:03] nicegraham: not sure what's changed...
[2013-07-24 05:28:12] nicegraham: are you going to push those jni chagnes to dev?
[2013-07-24 05:28:31] freynaud: when it's done yes
[2013-07-24 05:28:42] freynaud: I finished triaging most of the bugs, and fixed some
[2013-07-24 05:28:54] freynaud: JNI -> JNA starts now.
[2013-07-24 05:29:36] nicegraham: so the native flick tests pass, it's just the web ones

[2013-07-24 05:39:29] ags: Finally.. My office network is hiccuping me out of here a bit.
[2013-07-24 05:39:36] nicegraham: :)
[2013-07-24 05:40:48] nicegraham: I see the maven repo is created, so we just need to push a jar up now
[2013-07-24 05:40:55] ags: So, I got "access" to maven.org. I'd like to release v0.6 into there.
[2013-07-24 05:41:09] nicegraham: yeah, that sounds good
[2013-07-24 05:41:20] nicegraham: I had a go this morning
[2013-07-24 05:41:28] nicegraham: but I was hitting all sorts of problems
[2013-07-24 05:41:45] nicegraham: I've never had to do it before
[2013-07-24 05:41:53] nicegraham: so that made it more complicated
[2013-07-24 05:42:15] nicegraham: I think I've now got all the pre-requisites in place
[2013-07-24 05:42:21] nicegraham: and I added the missing bits to the pom
[2013-07-24 05:42:36] nicegraham: but when I start the deploy process its giving me errors
[2013-07-24 05:42:44] ags: What errors?
[2013-07-24 05:43:01] ags: I should be able to help with maven problems
