[2013-04-03 03:41:43] freynaud: Good morning
[2013-04-03 03:44:37] AutomatedTester: freynaud: had an email from GSoC saying we can update our proposals
[2013-04-03 03:44:47] AutomatedTester: have you made your relevant changes
[2013-04-03 03:44:58] AutomatedTester: if not can you do it right now
[2013-04-03 03:46:59] freynaud: I have a meeting just now
[2013-04-03 03:47:04] freynaud: I'll do it after it

[2013-04-03 04:47:24] AutomatedTester: freynaud: skill level
[2013-04-03 04:47:26] AutomatedTester: hard?
[2013-04-03 04:54:11] freynaud: AutomatedTester: depends.
[2013-04-03 04:54:17] freynaud: inspector is easy
[2013-04-03 04:54:21] freynaud: the rest is harder
[2013-04-03 04:54:37] freynaud: inspector is JS + CSS, anyone should be able to do that
[2013-04-03 04:56:24] AutomatedTester: I'll put hard
[2013-04-03 04:59:11] freynaud: thx
[2013-04-03 05:07:34] AutomatedTester: freynaud: spreadsheet has been updated
[2013-04-03 05:31:45] freynaud: very cool
[2013-04-03 05:33:16] AutomatedTester: freynaud: I had an email from them overnight asking us to make it better and I think I have done all they asked
[2013-04-03 05:43:55] freynaud: AutomatedTester: if you need me to follow up with them direclty, just add me to the thread
[2013-04-03 05:44:11] AutomatedTester: freynaud: ok

[2013-04-03 08:02:41] freynaud: k
[2013-04-03 08:07:35] nicegraham: freynaud: I'm back :)
[2013-04-03 08:07:53] freynaud: wb
[2013-04-03 08:08:18] nicegraham: I started looking at the capability matched
[2013-04-03 08:08:20] nicegraham: matcher
[2013-04-03 08:08:40] nicegraham: you gave me some pointers on debugging it before but I need more guidance
[2013-04-03 08:08:46] nicegraham: I have the selenium codebase downloaded
[2013-04-03 08:09:14] nicegraham: so how do I start the grid in the ide specifying my matcher?
[2013-04-03 08:10:32] freynaud: GridLauncher
[2013-04-03 08:11:03] freynaud: pass the pram -role hub -capabilityMatcher com.yourcompany.YourMatcher
[2013-04-03 08:19:43] nicegraham: just discovered a nice intellij shortcut ctrl+shift+n
[2013-04-03 08:19:51] nicegraham: allows you to serach for a file...
[2013-04-03 08:20:39] nicegraham: and the matcher class needs to be in the classpath?
[2013-04-03 08:20:45] nicegraham: or how does it find it?
[2013-04-03 08:21:13] ddary: classpath
[2013-04-03 08:22:12] nicegraham: ddary: cheers
[2013-04-03 08:23:32] ddary: nicegraham: the full command is something like this: java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -cp "selendroid-grid-plugin-1.0.jar:selenium-server-standalone-2.29.0.jar" org.openqa.grid.selenium.GridLauncher -capabilityMatcher org.openqa.selendroid.grid.SelendroidCapabilityMatcher -role hub host 127.0.0.1 -port 4444 -throwOnCapabilityNotPresent false

[2013-04-03 09:18:58] nicegraham: ah, so there's CI now..
[2013-04-03 09:19:21] lukeis: heh, yeah, i got some emails there too ;)
[2013-04-03 09:19:47] nicegraham: it's in beta by the looks of it :)
[2013-04-03 09:20:29] lukeis: i woke up this morning to 50+ new emails in my inbox all from ios-driver / travis ;)
[2013-04-03 09:21:40] lukeis: nicegraham: so ios-driver 0.6 doesn't work on real devices for apps? I thought it did/would
[2013-04-03 09:22:09] nicegraham: 0.6 does for native apps anyway... though I haven't tested that claim myself
[2013-04-03 09:22:38] nicegraham: if you're referring to my comment in that issue... I made that before 0.6
[2013-04-03 09:22:52] nicegraham: francois ported them all today to the new project
[2013-04-03 09:22:52] lukeis: ahh :-D
[2013-04-03 09:22:57] nicegraham: so it's out of whack...
[2013-04-03 09:23:05] lukeis: yeah, context is lost a bit
[2013-04-03 09:23:13] lukeis: timestamps and who said what
[2013-04-03 09:23:19] nicegraham: along with the fact that all comments are by him now... :)
[2013-04-03 09:23:25] lukeis: yeah
[2013-04-03 09:23:49] nicegraham: they should offer a mechanism to move them properly
[2013-04-03 09:34:09] freynaud: lukeis: what spam ?
[2013-04-03 09:34:27] lukeis: when you moved the issues, i got an email for every comment
[2013-04-03 09:35:58] freynaud: :)
[2013-04-03 09:36:01] freynaud: I didn't
[2013-04-03 09:36:17] lukeis: that's cause github saw it as *you* making the comments ;)
[2013-04-03 09:37:08] lukeis: github doesn't email you your own activity (except for ssh keys and forking)
[2013-04-03 09:44:32] freynaud: with travis I had less chance so far
[2013-04-03 09:44:42] lukeis: freynaud: think you can close ios-driver/ios-driver#9 ? or did you still want to look into it?
[2013-04-03 09:44:57] freynaud: but I hope it will work
[2013-04-03 09:44:59] lukeis: #9
[2013-04-03 09:45:16] lukeis: cool, just checking i made the bot default to the right place ;)
[2013-04-03 09:46:01] freynaud: closed
[2013-04-03 09:46:14] freynaud: it will now say : language XYZ isn't supported
[2013-04-03 09:48:34] freynaud: and there is a test for it :)
[2013-04-03 09:48:42] freynaud: lukeis: have you used travis ?
[2013-04-03 09:49:01] lukeis: nope
[2013-04-03 09:49:41] lukeis: can you give me access to configure the job?
[2013-04-03 09:49:52] lukeis: i can tinker ;)
[2013-04-03 09:51:11] freynaud: i do'nt think so
