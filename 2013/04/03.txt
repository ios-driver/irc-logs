[2013-04-03 03:44:37] AutomatedTester: freynaud: had an email from GSoC saying we can update our proposals
[2013-04-03 03:44:47] AutomatedTester: have you made your relevant changes
[2013-04-03 03:44:58] AutomatedTester: if not can you do it right now
[2013-04-03 03:46:59] freynaud: I have a meeting just now
[2013-04-03 03:47:04] freynaud: I'll do it after it

[2013-04-03 04:47:26] AutomatedTester: hard?
[2013-04-03 04:54:11] freynaud: AutomatedTester: depends.
[2013-04-03 04:54:17] freynaud: inspector is easy
[2013-04-03 04:54:21] freynaud: the rest is harder
[2013-04-03 04:54:37] freynaud: inspector is JS + CSS, anyone should be able to do that
[2013-04-03 04:56:24] AutomatedTester: I'll put hard
[2013-04-03 04:59:11] freynaud: thx
[2013-04-03 05:07:34] AutomatedTester: freynaud: spreadsheet has been updated
[2013-04-03 05:31:45] freynaud: very cool

[2013-04-03 08:07:53] freynaud: wb
[2013-04-03 08:08:18] nicegraham: I started looking at the capability matched
[2013-04-03 08:08:20] nicegraham: matcher
[2013-04-03 08:08:40] nicegraham: you gave me some pointers on debugging it before but I need more guidance
[2013-04-03 08:08:46] nicegraham: I have the selenium codebase downloaded
[2013-04-03 08:09:14] nicegraham: so how do I start the grid in the ide specifying my matcher?
[2013-04-03 08:10:32] freynaud: GridLauncher
[2013-04-03 08:11:03] freynaud: pass the pram -role hub -capabilityMatcher com.yourcompany.YourMatcher
[2013-04-03 08:19:43] nicegraham: just discovered a nice intellij shortcut ctrl+shift+n
[2013-04-03 08:19:51] nicegraham: allows you to serach for a file...
[2013-04-03 08:20:39] nicegraham: and the matcher class needs to be in the classpath?
[2013-04-03 08:20:45] nicegraham: or how does it find it?
[2013-04-03 08:21:13] ddary: classpath
[2013-04-03 08:22:12] nicegraham: ddary: cheers
[2013-04-03 08:23:32] ddary: nicegraham: the full command is something like this: java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -cp "selendroid-grid-plugin-1.0.jar:selenium-server-standalone-2.29.0.jar" org.openqa.grid.selenium.GridLauncher -capabilityMatcher org.openqa.selendroid.grid.SelendroidCapabilityMatcher -role hub host 127.0.0.1 -port 4444 -throwOnCapabilityNotPresent false

[2013-04-03 09:19:21] lukeis: heh, yeah, i got some emails there too ;)
[2013-04-03 09:19:47] nicegraham: it's in beta by the looks of it :)
[2013-04-03 09:20:29] lukeis: i woke up this morning to 50+ new emails in my inbox all from ios-driver / travis ;)
[2013-04-03 09:21:40] lukeis: nicegraham: so ios-driver 0.6 doesn't work on real devices for apps? I thought it did/would
[2013-04-03 09:22:09] nicegraham: 0.6 does for native apps anyway... though I haven't tested that claim myself
[2013-04-03 09:22:38] nicegraham: if you're referring to my comment in that issue... I made that before 0.6
[2013-04-03 09:22:52] nicegraham: francois ported them all today to the new project
[2013-04-03 09:22:52] lukeis: ahh :-D
[2013-04-03 09:22:57] nicegraham: so it's out of whack...
[2013-04-03 09:23:05] lukeis: yeah, context is lost a bit
[2013-04-03 09:23:13] lukeis: timestamps and who said what
[2013-04-03 09:23:19] nicegraham: along with the fact that all comments are by him now... :)
[2013-04-03 09:23:25] lukeis: yeah
[2013-04-03 09:23:49] nicegraham: they should offer a mechanism to move them properly
[2013-04-03 09:34:09] freynaud: lukeis: what spam ?
[2013-04-03 09:34:27] lukeis: when you moved the issues, i got an email for every comment
[2013-04-03 09:35:58] freynaud: :)
[2013-04-03 09:36:01] freynaud: I didn't
[2013-04-03 09:36:17] lukeis: that's cause github saw it as *you* making the comments ;)
[2013-04-03 09:37:08] lukeis: github doesn't email you your own activity (except for ssh keys and forking)
[2013-04-03 09:44:32] freynaud: with travis I had less chance so far
[2013-04-03 09:44:42] lukeis: freynaud: think you can close ios-driver/ios-driver#9 ? or did you still want to look into it?
[2013-04-03 09:44:57] freynaud: but I hope it will work
[2013-04-03 09:44:59] lukeis: #9
[2013-04-03 09:45:16] lukeis: cool, just checking i made the bot default to the right place ;)
[2013-04-03 09:46:01] freynaud: closed
[2013-04-03 09:46:14] freynaud: it will now say : language XYZ isn't supported
[2013-04-03 09:48:34] freynaud: and there is a test for it :)
[2013-04-03 09:48:42] freynaud: lukeis: have you used travis ?
[2013-04-03 09:49:01] lukeis: nope
[2013-04-03 09:49:41] lukeis: can you give me access to configure the job?
[2013-04-03 09:49:52] lukeis: i can tinker ;)

[2013-04-03 10:04:28] lukeis: oh, success!!!
[2013-04-03 10:04:30] nicegraham: it's passing now though ;)
[2013-04-03 10:05:04] lukeis: not doing many tests?
[2013-04-03 10:05:30] nicegraham: will it allow the simulator tests to run?
[2013-04-03 10:07:08] freynaud: i commented out the tests
[2013-04-03 10:07:25] freynaud: to see if it goes to a osx box etv
[2013-04-03 10:07:54] nicegraham: it's free for open source projects?
[2013-04-03 10:08:11] lukeis: yes
[2013-04-03 10:08:23] nicegraham: nicely
[2013-04-03 10:08:34] freynaud: I'm more concerned about the /etc/authorization file that has to be modified
[2013-04-03 10:08:35] lukeis: OSX seems to be a beta pilot, that francois is on ;)
[2013-04-03 10:08:39] freynaud: i think that will be the issue
[2013-04-03 10:08:57] freynaud: but I talk to travis, they should be able to do that. We just have to file a bug
[2013-04-03 10:08:58] nicegraham: oh yeah :)
[2013-04-03 10:09:21] lukeis: do we have docs to do that? or do we do that automatically?
[2013-04-03 10:09:24] *lukeis forgets'
[2013-04-03 10:09:37] nicegraham: it's not automatic
[2013-04-03 10:09:49] nicegraham: that stops the allow access dialog right?
[2013-04-03 10:09:54] lukeis: i remember doing it on appiumâ€¦ back in the python days ;)
[2013-04-03 10:10:01] lukeis: yes
[2013-04-03 10:10:04] nicegraham: oh appium... :)

[2013-04-03 10:10:41] lukeis: i might be using it for android automationâ€¦ if they figure out webviews ;)
[2013-04-03 10:10:51] freynaud:  the /etc files require sudo
[2013-04-03 10:10:54] lukeis: but i am certainly using selendroid for now too
[2013-04-03 10:10:56] lukeis: yes
[2013-04-03 10:10:57] nicegraham: and they'll allow the chmod of the mobilesafari app?
[2013-04-03 10:11:21] lukeis: we need that back in the docs btwâ€¦ it seems to have disappeared
[2013-04-03 10:11:31] lukeis: chmod of plist in mobile safari
[2013-04-03 10:11:39] nicegraham: it outputs it in the console though I think...
[2013-04-03 10:11:59] lukeis: it's not painfully obvious
[2013-04-03 10:12:14] lukeis: docs can do it too
[2013-04-03 10:12:35] lukeis: the output recommends something that isn't actually what one needs to do thought
[2013-04-03 10:12:37] nicegraham: yeah, for sure
[2013-04-03 10:12:57] nicegraham: also the authorization change too should be documented
[2013-04-03 10:13:20] nicegraham: I googled when i [quickly] got sick of clicking yes
[2013-04-03 10:13:31] freynaud: i'll try to copy safari first
[2013-04-03 10:13:44] freynaud: it may work
[2013-04-03 10:14:24] lukeis: my instructions on the old appium project: "To avoid a security dialog that can appear when launching your iOS app, you need to modify your /etc/authorization file. You can do this by settings the element following <allow-root> under <key>system.privilege.taskport</key> to <true/>"
[2013-04-03 10:15:19] nicegraham: it could probably be more step-by-step :)
[2013-04-03 10:15:33] *nicegraham can't remember how to do that ^'
[2013-04-03 10:16:16] lukeis: we had a python script to do it tooâ€¦ appium ported that to javascript / grunt
[2013-04-03 10:16:59] lukeis: https://github.com/hugs/appium-old/blob/master/authorize.py
[2013-04-03 10:17:02] lukeis: :)
[2013-04-03 10:17:22] lukeis: that was only 4 months ago?
[2013-04-03 10:17:36] lukeis: time flies ;)
[2013-04-03 10:22:37] freynaud: -rw-r--r-- is my /etc/authorization
[2013-04-03 10:22:57] lukeis: that's fine, it's about the contents of it ;)

[2013-04-03 11:43:37] santiycr: nicegraham:  yup
[2013-04-03 11:44:22] nicegraham: and you've given TestApp location to ios-driver on launch?
[2013-04-03 11:44:23] santiycr: I can't confirm it's trying to start safari, but it does fail complaining about being unable to write to the MobileSafari plist
[2013-04-03 11:44:32] santiycr: yup
[2013-04-03 11:44:47] nicegraham: and can see it in TestApp in the capabilites on the server in a browser?
[2013-04-03 11:45:05] nicegraham: you need to chmod the plist to allow ios-driver to update the plist
[2013-04-03 11:45:41] nicegraham: ok, it's not actually starting it in the simulator?
[2013-04-03 11:46:07] nicegraham: the first thing to fix is the plist problem - that may be the cause
[2013-04-03 11:46:26] nicegraham: it tells you in the console what file to update rights?
[2013-04-03 11:46:45] santiycr: hm, let me confirm that
[2013-04-03 11:47:35] nicegraham: lukeis: really need to get that plist documented :)
[2013-04-03 11:48:21] santiycr: hm, now I can't repro the problem locally
[2013-04-03 11:48:24] santiycr: only in our vm
[2013-04-03 11:48:32] santiycr: sorry guys, I'll need to investigate more
[2013-04-03 11:48:50] nicegraham: that's ok - it's probably just the plist isn't editable on the VM
[2013-04-03 11:49:12] nicegraham: ios-driver may be bombing out when that fails - I can't remember :)
[2013-04-03 12:02:55] santiycr: hm, ok
[2013-04-03 12:03:03] santiycr: I'll get that damn plist taken care of first
[2013-04-03 12:03:14] santiycr: then I'll focus on getting native support in

[2013-04-03 12:07:17] nicegraham: replace 6.1 with whichever sdk you have
[2013-04-03 12:07:29] lukeis: just replace it with a * ;)
