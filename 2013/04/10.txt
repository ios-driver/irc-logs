[2013-04-10 11:44:32] nicegraham: hey lukies
[2013-04-10 11:44:35] nicegraham: lukeis
[2013-04-10 11:44:53] lukeis: one more time and i may appear ;)
[2013-04-10 11:45:09] nicegraham: I'm rubbing a lamp furiously here...
[2013-04-10 11:45:35] *lukeis tries very hard to not picture that'
[2013-04-10 11:45:40] nicegraham: haha
[2013-04-10 11:45:46] nicegraham: yeah, I though that
[2013-04-10 11:46:03] nicegraham: I see they replied
[2013-04-10 11:46:21] nicegraham: the primary difference is the lack of webview in appium right?
[2013-04-10 11:46:37] nicegraham: and we can test safari?
[2013-04-10 11:46:55] lukeis: appium supports safari now
[2013-04-10 11:47:07] lukeis: they even are passing more core selenium tests against it than we are now
[2013-04-10 11:47:27] nicegraham: hmm, will have to sort that out
[2013-04-10 11:47:50] nicegraham: I'll get back to tests when I finish the capability matcher
[2013-04-10 11:48:14] lukeis: key differences are we implement "native" key presses and touch/click instead of synthetic via javascript (we also support that)

[2013-04-10 11:52:32] lukeis: nicegraham: appium supports hybrid ;)
[2013-04-10 11:52:41] nicegraham: oh well
[2013-04-10 11:53:02] nicegraham: but it doesn't on android then?
[2013-04-10 11:53:30] lukeis: try not to make assumptions about itâ€¦ best to just be honest and say I don't know what appium supports (let the appium crowd chime in)
[2013-04-10 11:53:52] jlipps, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-04-10 11:54:17] nicegraham: yeah fair enough, I honestly didn't think it did
[2013-04-10 11:54:36] lukeis: WebView support in android with UIAutomator  is still under investigation I believe ;)   (the man who just entered knows more likely)
[2013-04-10 11:55:04] nicegraham: that's what I had in my head
