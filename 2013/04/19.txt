[2013-04-19 01:39:46] nicegraham: freynaud: how do I add pages to the test resources so I can unit test the touch actions?
[2013-04-19 01:40:39] freynaud: what do you mean?
[2013-04-19 01:41:17] nicegraham: I want to create a page with a control which supports swipes, drag and drop etc
[2013-04-19 01:41:34] nicegraham: looking at the code it's using a compiled appserver?
[2013-04-19 01:41:50] freynaud: you can find an example on apple example site.
[2013-04-19 01:42:29] nicegraham: yeah, I have some sample html
[2013-04-19 01:42:47] nicegraham: but where do I add that in our project so I can test against it?
[2013-04-19 01:43:09] freynaud: test resource
[2013-04-19 01:43:32] nicegraham: ok, the current tests are using base.jar it looks like?
[2013-04-19 01:43:38] freynaud: https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/tree/master/server/src/test/resources/sampleApps
[2013-04-19 01:43:43] nicegraham: so ignore that and add my own?
[2013-04-19 01:44:06] nicegraham: this would be a webpage
[2013-04-19 01:44:17] nicegraham: I'll add an application in next week
[2013-04-19 01:44:26] nicegraham: I want to unit test on both safari and a native app
[2013-04-19 01:45:01] freynaud: no sure
[2013-04-19 01:45:17] freynaud: never done it, I  used the selenium tests as is
[2013-04-19 01:45:25] freynaud: there should be swipe tests in there
[2013-04-19 01:46:52] nicegraham: ok, I'll look more
[2013-04-19 01:47:00] nicegraham: I've found a drag and drop page at least
[2013-04-19 03:20:16] nicegraham: freynaud: I've located a bunch of touch tests in the Selenium project under interactions.touch
[2013-04-19 03:20:46] nicegraham: should I create a corresponding area in ios-driver or just port the test classes to the root directory?
[2013-04-19 03:22:11] freynaud: port the tests would be better
[2013-04-19 03:22:25] freynaud: ideally, mid term, we should switch to plain selenium tests

[2013-04-19 03:27:22] nicegraham: I will port them either way
[2013-04-19 03:27:30] nicegraham: I meant from a structure persepctive
[2013-04-19 03:28:06] nicegraham: should I create a uiautomation.ios.selenium.interactions.touch package?
[2013-04-19 03:28:18] freynaud: sure
[2013-04-19 03:28:34] freynaud: whatever convention is in the selenium project
[2013-04-19 03:29:27] nicegraham: ok, cool - will do

[2013-04-19 09:39:27] lukeis: ;)
[2013-04-19 09:39:55] nicegraham: yep, welcome to my evening :)
[2013-04-19 09:40:23] lukeis: my morning is trying to figure out why safari is acting funny with cookies
[2013-04-19 09:40:34] nicegraham: on ios?
[2013-04-19 09:40:44] lukeis: nopeâ€¦ desktop
[2013-04-19 09:41:01] nicegraham: easier to debug at least...
[2013-04-19 09:41:08] lukeis: not really ;)
