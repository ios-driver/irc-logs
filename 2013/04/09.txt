[2013-04-09 20:21:02] lukeis: heya santiycr, was forwarded the email about ipad, not sure I understand what the problem is. have time to chat? (or let me know if tomorrow is better?)
[2013-04-09 20:25:17] lukeis: santiycr: 'browserName': 'iPad'  is a convenience mapping of capabilities, the "real" ones it wants are 'CFBundleName':Â 'Safari'   and 'device'Â :Â 'ipad'    if we use those capabilities instead will it work?
