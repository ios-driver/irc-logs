[2013-04-12 06:59:26] dawagner: If I launch the head ios-server with the -beta flag, I get a segfault? Has anyone else seen this?
[2013-04-12 07:07:34] nicegraham: dawagner: no, haven't seen that
[2013-04-12 07:07:47] nicegraham: what option parameters are you using?
[2013-04-12 07:08:44] nicegraham: have you got a device connected when you launch the server?
