[2013-04-12 06:59:26] dawagner: If I launch the head ios-server with the -beta flag, I get a segfault? Has anyone else seen this?
[2013-04-12 07:07:34] nicegraham: dawagner: no, haven't seen that
[2013-04-12 07:07:47] nicegraham: what option parameters are you using?
[2013-04-12 07:08:44] nicegraham: have you got a device connected when you launch the server?
[2013-04-12 07:15:16] dawagner: This was just from a fresh git checkout
[2013-04-12 07:15:30] dawagner: `java -jar ios-server-0.6.0.jar -port 4444 -host localhost` works fine
[2013-04-12 07:15:38] dawagner: `java -jar ios-server-0.6.0.jar -port 4444 -host localhost -beta` segfaults
[2013-04-12 07:15:52] dawagner: (I found this out by trying to run the tests in intellij from a fresh checkout)
[2013-04-12 07:16:31] dawagner: No device, just a simulator
[2013-04-12 07:19:16] dawagner: And separate question: What's the full set of tests I should run before committing?
[2013-04-12 07:19:43] nicegraham: there's a testng file....
[2013-04-12 07:20:16] nicegraham: testng.xml in ios-selenium-tests/src/test/resources
[2013-04-12 07:20:28] nicegraham: and in server/src/test/resources
[2013-04-12 07:21:08] dawagner: How does one run those? :)
[2013-04-12 07:21:19] dawagner: (Sorry, never used testng before, and not a maven person :))
[2013-04-12 07:22:30] nicegraham: right click in intellij
[2013-04-12 07:22:56] nicegraham: and run '/path/filename'
[2013-04-12 07:23:15] dawagner: Awesome, thanks :)
[2013-04-12 07:23:34] nicegraham: no problem, your seg fault I've never seen I'm afraid
[2013-04-12 07:23:54] dawagner: Oh well, I can do some debugging there, but live without -beta for now :)
[2013-04-12 07:24:03] nicegraham: but I haven't been doing much with -beta / physical devices
[2013-04-12 07:24:13] nicegraham: freynaud is your man for that
[2013-04-12 07:24:27] dawagner: Any github conventions I should know about? Commit to main repo? Commit to fork and merge?
[2013-04-12 07:24:38] nicegraham: we're using dev branch
[2013-04-12 07:24:47] nicegraham: so make pull requests against that if you can
[2013-04-12 07:25:00] nicegraham: that's also the most up to date codebase

[2013-04-12 07:25:31] dawagner: I have commit rights to ios-driver - should I commit there?
[2013-04-12 07:25:55] nicegraham: to the dev branch
[2013-04-12 07:26:06] nicegraham: the master branch is the released version 0.6.0
[2013-04-12 07:26:13] nicegraham: and it's stable
[2013-04-12 07:26:21] dawagner: Awesome, will do :)
[2013-04-12 07:26:22] dawagner: Thanks!
[2013-04-12 07:26:36] nicegraham: np :)

[2013-04-12 07:27:18] dawagner: la la learning git as I go along...
[2013-04-12 07:28:25] nicegraham: yeah, me too
[2013-04-12 07:28:45] nicegraham: when it breaks, get in touch with lukeis
[2013-04-12 07:28:55] dawagner: Will do!
[2013-04-12 07:28:57] nicegraham: he's pulled my bacon out of the fire a few times now :)
[2013-04-12 07:29:40] dawagner: He is a great guy :) [and not even around to get embarrassed by my praise!]
[2013-04-12 07:29:57] nicegraham: yep, he's been very patient and forgiving :)
