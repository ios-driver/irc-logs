[2013-04-08 00:16:40] nicegraham: good morning all
[2013-04-08 00:38:58] freynaud: Good morning
[2013-04-08 00:42:42] nicegraham: freynaud: I added some guidance on real devices based on that github issue
[2013-04-08 00:43:08] nicegraham: I want to confirm that you need to archive before you can test against the app?
[2013-04-08 00:45:02] freynaud: you don't
[2013-04-08 00:45:45] nicegraham: hmm
[2013-04-08 00:46:06] nicegraham: ok, any idea why it didn't work prior to me archiving?#
[2013-04-08 00:47:28] freynaud: you need the .iap from somewhere
[2013-04-08 00:47:42] freynaud: if you build it correctly, you can use that
[2013-04-08 00:47:53] freynaud: if you have it installed, you need to copy it from the ddeviced
[2013-04-08 00:48:28] nicegraham: I built/ran it using the profile option in xcode which deployed it to the device
[2013-04-08 00:48:37] freynaud: and copy = archive > backup the archive
[2013-04-08 00:50:11] nicegraham: so if I have the app deployed on a device and have the application file in the ~/applications folder it will work without archiving?
[2013-04-08 00:54:42] freynaud: yes
[2013-04-08 00:54:57] freynaud: if it doesn't, it's probably because it's not built properly
[2013-04-08 00:55:17] nicegraham: ok, but in the absence of that archiving the deployed application achieves the same thing@
[2013-04-08 00:55:18] freynaud: it needs to use the provisioning profile installed on the device, and the correct entitilments
[2013-04-08 00:55:19] nicegraham: ?
[2013-04-08 00:55:24] freynaud: yes
[2013-04-08 00:55:41] freynaud: i think the documentation will say : if you're not sure, use archive
[2013-04-08 00:55:55] freynaud: if you understand the types of builds et, you can skip that
[2013-04-08 00:55:58] nicegraham: right, the docs as they stand tell the person to archive
[2013-04-08 00:56:08] nicegraham: which will get them up and running
[2013-04-08 00:56:21] nicegraham: it could probably use more details on the other options

[2013-04-08 05:52:11] nicegraham__: freynaud: I have a ipad mini connected but on /status it lists the device as iphone - is that expected?
[2013-04-08 05:53:56] freynaud: no
[2013-04-08 05:54:36] freynaud: but I don't have an iPad mini, so I can't check
[2013-04-08 05:54:48] freynaud: I'll need to buy some devices
[2013-04-08 05:55:06] freynaud: but I'm redoing the inspector first this week, while I'm off in France
[2013-04-08 05:56:14] nicegraham__: do you want to point me in the direction of what info you need to parse and I can provide it / implement the ipad mini portion?
