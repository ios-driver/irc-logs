[2013-04-08 00:16:40] nicegraham: good morning all
[2013-04-08 00:38:58] freynaud: Good morning
[2013-04-08 00:42:42] nicegraham: freynaud: I added some guidance on real devices based on that github issue
[2013-04-08 00:43:08] nicegraham: I want to confirm that you need to archive before you can test against the app?
[2013-04-08 00:45:02] freynaud: you don't
[2013-04-08 00:45:45] nicegraham: hmm
[2013-04-08 00:46:06] nicegraham: ok, any idea why it didn't work prior to me archiving?#
[2013-04-08 00:47:28] freynaud: you need the .iap from somewhere
[2013-04-08 00:47:42] freynaud: if you build it correctly, you can use that
[2013-04-08 00:47:53] freynaud: if you have it installed, you need to copy it from the ddeviced
[2013-04-08 00:48:28] nicegraham: I built/ran it using the profile option in xcode which deployed it to the device
[2013-04-08 00:48:37] freynaud: and copy = archive > backup the archive
[2013-04-08 00:50:11] nicegraham: so if I have the app deployed on a device and have the application file in the ~/applications folder it will work without archiving?
[2013-04-08 00:54:42] freynaud: yes
[2013-04-08 00:54:57] freynaud: if it doesn't, it's probably because it's not built properly
[2013-04-08 00:55:17] nicegraham: ok, but in the absence of that archiving the deployed application achieves the same thing@
[2013-04-08 00:55:18] freynaud: it needs to use the provisioning profile installed on the device, and the correct entitilments
[2013-04-08 00:55:19] nicegraham: ?
[2013-04-08 00:55:24] freynaud: yes
[2013-04-08 00:55:41] freynaud: i think the documentation will say : if you're not sure, use archive
[2013-04-08 00:55:55] freynaud: if you understand the types of builds et, you can skip that
[2013-04-08 00:55:58] nicegraham: right, the docs as they stand tell the person to archive
[2013-04-08 00:56:08] nicegraham: which will get them up and running
[2013-04-08 00:56:21] nicegraham: it could probably use more details on the other options

[2013-04-08 05:52:11] nicegraham__: freynaud: I have a ipad mini connected but on /status it lists the device as iphone - is that expected?
[2013-04-08 05:53:56] freynaud: no
[2013-04-08 05:54:36] freynaud: but I don't have an iPad mini, so I can't check
[2013-04-08 05:54:48] freynaud: I'll need to buy some devices
[2013-04-08 05:55:06] freynaud: but I'm redoing the inspector first this week, while I'm off in France
[2013-04-08 05:56:14] nicegraham__: do you want to point me in the direction of what info you need to parse and I can provide it / implement the ipad mini portion?
[2013-04-08 06:02:21] nicegraham__, changing nick to nicegraham.
[2013-04-08 06:47:46] nicegraham: freynaud: looking at the code the problem is when the device capabilities are merged with the app capabilities, the app caps are being given precedence and so although the device lists ipad InternationalMountains lists iphone and that's what status is returning
[2013-04-08 06:48:15] nicegraham: I think the device should take precedence here, what do you think?
[2013-04-08 06:57:31] nicegraham: it also means there are capabilities like deviceAlt, sdkAlt which the application may support but the device clearly doesn't - should those still be present when it's a physical device?
[2013-04-08 07:09:09] nicegraham: the version returned is iPad2,5 which is iPad Mini Wifi only, should I add a reference to the DeviceVariation for it?

[2013-04-08 08:20:56] freynaud: nicegraham: is there a difference for that ?
[2013-04-08 08:21:04] freynaud: the simulator doesn't even offer it
[2013-04-08 08:21:12] freynaud: it's the same resolution as the regular ipad
[2013-04-08 08:38:47] nicegraham: freynaud: sorry, I was away
[2013-04-08 08:38:58] nicegraham: yeah, it has the same resolution as the ipad 2
[2013-04-08 08:39:38] nicegraham: is that the criteria, resolution?
[2013-04-08 08:45:09] nicegraham: I had a chat with the mobile test team here
[2013-04-08 08:45:44] nicegraham: and they would test the ipad mini seperately because there have been os releases for it which have not been available for other ipads
[2013-04-08 08:45:58] nicegraham: of course that could be managed from a iosVersion perspective
[2013-04-08 08:46:49] nicegraham: it just seems a bit inconclusive if we're not specifying which model of a device is available

[2013-04-08 08:51:06] lukeis: nice to see :)  i am liking selendroid a little more right nowâ€¦ if only for the point i don't need to bundle the testing server code/jar with my app
[2013-04-08 08:51:22] nicegraham: yeah, that's nice alright
[2013-04-08 08:51:30] nicegraham: just wanted to to give toks some props
[2013-04-08 08:51:31] nicegraham: :)
[2013-04-08 08:52:10] lukeis: yeah, and here I directed toks to appdriver initially ;)
[2013-04-08 08:52:54] nicegraham: I know

[2013-04-08 14:28:25] ddary, leaving. (#ios-driver)
[2013-04-08 14:40:19] Hammertime38: The GetAttribute method returns a string in C#. GetAttribute("rect") uses the protocol to construct a json object, but it must be dynamic because C# converts it to a dictionary.  So the method result is always "System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary`2[System.String,System.Object]"
