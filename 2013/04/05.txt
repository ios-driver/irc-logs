[2013-04-05 10:48:01] dgrace: thanks for reviewing that stuff for me yesterday!
[2013-04-05 10:48:16] dgrace: i'm looking at some other stuff today and wanted your opinion if thats cool?
[2013-04-05 10:48:26] lukeis: no worriesâ€¦ sure
[2013-04-05 10:49:00] dgrace: i am implementing some of the touch stuff from uiatarget
[2013-04-05 10:49:22] dgrace: they don't match very well with the existing touchscreen stuff in the json wire protocol
[2013-04-05 10:49:48] dgrace: so i have implemented some of that stuff today as part of the iosaugmenter
[2013-04-05 10:49:54] dgrace: reckon that is ok?
