[2013-04-05 10:47:20] dgrace: :lukeis hey Luke, you there?
[2013-04-05 10:47:38] lukeis: hi, yes
[2013-04-05 10:48:01] dgrace: thanks for reviewing that stuff for me yesterday!
[2013-04-05 10:48:16] dgrace: i'm looking at some other stuff today and wanted your opinion if thats cool?
[2013-04-05 10:48:26] lukeis: no worriesâ€¦ sure
[2013-04-05 10:49:00] dgrace: i am implementing some of the touch stuff from uiatarget
[2013-04-05 10:49:22] dgrace: they don't match very well with the existing touchscreen stuff in the json wire protocol
[2013-04-05 10:49:48] dgrace: so i have implemented some of that stuff today as part of the iosaugmenter
[2013-04-05 10:49:54] dgrace: reckon that is ok?
[2013-04-05 10:50:55] dgrace: e.g. dragFromToForDuration
[2013-04-05 10:51:13] lukeis: which stuff doesn't map exactly?
[2013-04-05 10:51:24] lukeis: and we can extend the protocol
[2013-04-05 10:51:40] *lukeis loads up the wire spec'
[2013-04-05 10:51:51] dgrace: pinchCloseFromToForDuration
[2013-04-05 10:53:17] dgrace: the drag and pinching stuff dont match up with existing json well
[2013-04-05 10:53:29] lukeis: yeah, we may need to extend it
[2013-04-05 10:54:54] lukeis: endpoint becomes something like:  /session/:sessionId/-ios-driver-pinch-close
[2013-04-05 10:55:37] lukeis: danielwh / AutomatedTester: is that the correct interpretation of the extending spec? ^
[2013-04-05 10:56:19] lukeis: might want to have it just be -ios-pinch-close
[2013-04-05 10:57:17] dgrace: is there much involved in getting the wire protocol extended?
[2013-04-05 10:57:31] lukeis: nope, it's 'vendor' specific
[2013-04-05 10:58:04] lukeis: so, we can do that, but we may want to have a discussion about it with the exact endpoints with our appium friends (jlipps)
[2013-04-05 10:58:41] dgrace: cool
[2013-04-05 10:59:19] dgrace: for the time being (our qa dept crying out for this).. i'll add it to the augumenter..
