[2013-11-25 05:55:24] Krishnan: hi
[2013-11-25 05:55:43] Krishnan: I have a real silly/dumb question.. Can someone please help me ?
[2013-11-25 05:56:26] Krishnan: basically trying to figure out how do I invoke the inspector... : http://ios-driver.github.io/ios-driver/inspector.html
[2013-11-25 05:56:50] nicegraham: you just need to breakpoint your test
[2013-11-25 05:56:58] nicegraham: and then hit the inspector url in your browser
[2013-11-25 05:57:13] nicegraham: there's only a single thread so if you don't breakpoint you can't load the inspector
[2013-11-25 05:57:27] Krishnan: I have setup a breakpoint in XCode and i see xcode is right now stopped and waiting for me to resume
[2013-11-25 05:57:41] Krishnan: but everytime I load http://localhost:5555/inspector
[2013-11-25 05:57:43] Krishnan: I see errors
[2013-11-25 05:57:54] Krishnan: java.lang.NullPointerException 	at org.uiautomation.ios.inspector.controllers.SessionGuesserController.canHandle(SessionGuesserController.java:43)
[2013-11-25 05:57:55] nicegraham: not in xcode
[2013-11-25 05:57:59] nicegraham: in your test code
[2013-11-25 05:58:11] nicegraham: so eclipse or intellij
[2013-11-25 05:58:25] Krishnan: LOL !! I knew I was doing a real dumb thing !
[2013-11-25 05:58:29] Krishnan: darn !!!
[2013-11-25 05:58:40] Krishnan: all the while I was putting up breakpoints in Xcode :-|
[2013-11-25 05:58:48] Krishnan: ^^embarrassed^^
[2013-11-25 05:58:51] nicegraham: that'd be a problem
[2013-11-25 05:58:53] nicegraham: no worreis
[2013-11-25 06:00:14] Krishnan: Thanks for the pointer nicegraham
[2013-11-25 06:00:24] Krishnan: Let me do it in eclipse
[2013-11-25 06:00:32] Krishnan: sigh! I should have asked 2 hrs back itself
