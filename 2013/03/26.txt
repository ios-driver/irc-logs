[2013-03-26 02:46:45] dgrace: freynaud: Hey Fran√ßois. I'm looking at implementing the touch actions stuff. Want to run it by you.
[2013-03-26 02:47:13] dgrace: I am implementing HasTouchScreen in RemoteIOSDriver
[2013-03-26 04:10:10] freynaud: dgrace: can you implement that in a branch ?
[2013-03-26 04:10:35] freynaud: I4d like to release 0.6 asap, and introducing new features at the last minute isn't a great idea
[2013-03-26 04:15:10] dgrace: of course, wouldn't commit anything at this stage. i'll work away on it here, probably won't be ready for a while anyway
[2013-03-26 04:17:19] dgrace: question i have though, when trying to get the keyboard, getKeyboard() in RemoteIOSDriver as part of TouchActions builder I get an exception org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException: cannot find keyboard

[2013-03-26 09:12:28] freynaud: i've troubleshoot my 76 failed this morning
[2013-03-26 09:12:43] freynaud: some NPE bubbling up with no valid messages

[2013-03-26 09:13:31] freynaud: it's not completely my fault btw
[2013-03-26 09:13:31] lukeis: i've seen those sometimes
[2013-03-26 09:13:35] lukeis: ;)
[2013-03-26 09:13:41] *lukeis lays no blame'

[2013-03-26 09:15:37] freynaud: for some reason, you cannot pass the throwable on this one
[2013-03-26 09:15:52] lukeis: 'we' can fix that ;)
