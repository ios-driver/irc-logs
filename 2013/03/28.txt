[2013-03-28 08:28:16] lukeis: i wonder what happened to the github irc bot? very strange that it's not working
[2013-03-28 08:29:04] nicegraham: is it a different one to the normal bot?
[2013-03-28 08:29:06] lukeis: nicegraham: thanks for doing that changeâ€¦ i think we also need platformVersion  (and according the webdriver spec we need platfromName)
[2013-03-28 08:29:08] lukeis: yes
[2013-03-28 08:29:37] nicegraham: that's easy to update [now I know where to do it] :)
[2013-03-28 08:29:59] nicegraham: so iOS and 6.0 for example?
