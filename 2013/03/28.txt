[2013-03-28 08:28:16] lukeis: i wonder what happened to the github irc bot? very strange that it's not working
[2013-03-28 08:29:04] nicegraham: is it a different one to the normal bot?
[2013-03-28 08:29:06] lukeis: nicegraham: thanks for doing that changeâ€¦ i think we also need platformVersion  (and according the webdriver spec we need platfromName)
[2013-03-28 08:29:08] lukeis: yes
[2013-03-28 08:29:37] nicegraham: that's easy to update [now I know where to do it] :)
[2013-03-28 08:29:59] nicegraham: so iOS and 6.0 for example?
[2013-03-28 08:30:11] lukeis: yes, 6.1 ;)
[2013-03-28 08:30:34] lukeis: keep just 'platform' though
[2013-03-28 08:30:47] lukeis: because the language bindings are up to the spec in this regards ;)
[2013-03-28 08:32:17] nicegraham: for name?
[2013-03-28 08:32:30] lukeis: so, if i'm not ridiculously clearâ€¦ we should have 'platform' 'platformName' 'platformVersion'
[2013-03-28 08:32:33] nicegraham: or do you mean platform = " iOS 6.1
[2013-03-28 08:32:45] lukeis: we can leave platform = 'iOS'
[2013-03-28 08:32:46] nicegraham: ah, ok
[2013-03-28 08:33:11] lukeis: also we should provide 'browserVersion' which in this case is the same as platformVersion
[2013-03-28 08:33:42] lukeis: but if we can get the app version someone for other apps, that might be nice
[2013-03-28 08:34:06] nicegraham: i used browserName for Safari
[2013-03-28 08:34:17] nicegraham: and I thought for any other apps we'd just return the name there?
[2013-03-28 08:34:17] lukeis: yep, and that was good ;)
[2013-03-28 08:34:31] lukeis: which is what you're doingâ€¦ i like it
[2013-03-28 08:34:35] nicegraham: ok, cool
[2013-03-28 08:34:58] nicegraham: I can add a version item if it's not already there
[2013-03-28 08:35:00] *lukeis didn't know if we exposed app.version somewhere'
[2013-03-28 08:35:07] nicegraham: it's in the meta data
[2013-03-28 08:35:15] nicegraham: CFBUndleVersion or something
[2013-03-28 08:35:29] lukeis: cool
[2013-03-28 08:35:54] lukeis: i think this is point release worthy
[2013-03-28 08:36:01] nicegraham: so return that as 'version'
[2013-03-28 08:36:14] nicegraham: sure, esp if it makes ruby work :)
[2013-03-28 08:36:21] lukeis: 'browserVersion' : '6.1'
[2013-03-28 08:36:50] lukeis: 'browserVersion': CFBundleVersion (or whatever) :)
[2013-03-28 08:40:16] nicegraham: so for version...
[2013-03-28 08:40:19] nicegraham: CFBundleVersion=8536.25
[2013-03-28 08:40:25] nicegraham: in Safari
[2013-03-28 08:42:39] lukeis: that's fine by me
[2013-03-28 08:43:06] nicegraham: ok, excellent :)
[2013-03-28 08:44:58] nicegraham: https://gist.github.com/nicegraham/5264220 happy?
[2013-03-28 08:46:09] lukeis: i'm hoping you just stripped out the quotes or are viewing it in a different way ;)
[2013-03-28 08:46:34] lukeis: but, yes
[2013-03-28 08:46:35] nicegraham: hmmm
[2013-03-28 08:46:59] nicegraham: I just copied the value from the response variable and then jsonlint'd it
[2013-03-28 08:47:18] nicegraham: but I haven't changed anything that would affect whether it's quoted or not...
[2013-03-28 08:48:16] nicegraham: that's pushed to dev too
[2013-03-28 08:50:21] AutomatedTester: lukeis: can you create a draft of what your GSoC will be for me please
[2013-03-28 08:50:43] AutomatedTester: I asked Francois but havent seen him today
[2013-03-28 08:50:48] lukeis: ohhhâ€¦ i need to 'do something'?? :(
[2013-03-28 08:51:47] nicegraham: AutomatedTester: he hasn't been on today
[2013-03-28 08:53:00] AutomatedTester: lukeis: its just a high level what the plan is
[2013-03-28 08:53:04] AutomatedTester: I can make stuff up
[2013-03-28 08:53:15] AutomatedTester: but Francois wanted to vet what I did so said he could do it
[2013-03-28 08:53:44] lukeis: i'd be making shit up tooâ€¦ "Make ios-driver better" is the general plan ;)
[2013-03-28 08:54:15] AutomatedTester: fine, I'll do that
[2013-03-28 08:54:23] nicegraham: are they graded against the outline?

[2013-03-28 09:02:51] lukeis: have a good one!

[2013-03-28 09:03:00] nicegraham: cheers, will you change that?
[2013-03-28 09:03:08] nicegraham: thx
[2013-03-28 09:03:16] lukeis: see ya next week

[2013-03-28 09:04:09] lukeis: heh, i'm not likely to be online ;) kids, house stuffâ€¦ i'm very middle aged
