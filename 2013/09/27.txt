[2013-09-27 00:01:31] freynaud: safari + instruments doesn't work anymore with ios7
[2013-09-27 00:01:35] freynaud: we need to solve that
[2013-09-27 00:04:02] nicegraham: he was trying safari
[2013-09-27 00:04:21] nicegraham: I think he raised a bug about it
[2013-09-27 00:04:42] nicegraham: #159
[2013-09-27 06:08:23] lrvick: freynaud: hrwm?
[2013-09-27 06:10:47] nicegraham: Irvick: he's away but around
[2013-09-27 06:11:21] nicegraham: spoke to him this morning - ios7 has broken mobile safari
[2013-09-27 06:11:26] nicegraham: we don't have a solution yet
[2013-09-27 06:11:33] nicegraham: and by we I mean him
[2013-09-27 06:11:34] nicegraham: :)

[2013-09-27 06:18:26] dawagner: Hello!
[2013-09-27 06:18:28] dawagner: How's it going?
[2013-09-27 06:18:30] nicegraham: what's the story with https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/pull/100
[2013-09-27 06:18:34] nicegraham: going well!
[2013-09-27 06:18:48] nicegraham: though I'm not enjoying the relentless march into winter
[2013-09-27 06:18:52] nicegraham: and the darkness

[2013-09-27 07:58:00] dawagner: RE that pull request: The intern who wrote the code's internship ended, but someone is going to pick it up in the next few days (he apologised to me for leaving it to sit a couple of days ago :))
[2013-09-27 07:58:41] dawagner: I'm enjoying what seems to be the only four weeks in New York when the weather is nice.  The summer is far too hot and far too humid, and the winter I hear isn't handled very well? But right now, it's lovely :)

[2013-09-27 08:03:17] nicegraham: yeah, NY in the summer is HOT!
[2013-09-27 08:03:30] nicegraham: I've also had the coldest experience of my life there in the winter
[2013-09-27 08:03:51] nicegraham: I was there in March and again in May this year and got lovely weather
[2013-09-27 08:04:03] nicegraham: well - May got a bit hot towards the end of the trip
[2013-09-27 08:05:44] dawagner: September is, I'm learning, the time to do it - I'll see what spring is like after the pain of winter!
[2013-09-27 08:08:58] AutomatedTester: in April it was lovely
