[2013-09-27 00:01:35] freynaud: we need to solve that
[2013-09-27 00:04:02] nicegraham: he was trying safari
[2013-09-27 00:04:21] nicegraham: I think he raised a bug about it

[2013-09-27 06:11:21] nicegraham: spoke to him this morning - ios7 has broken mobile safari
[2013-09-27 06:11:26] nicegraham: we don't have a solution yet
