[2013-09-02 03:24:34] dgrace: we haven't looked at it yet here..
[2013-09-02 04:00:50] freynaud: starting now
[2013-09-02 04:00:57] freynaud: native apps should be ok
[2013-09-02 04:01:02] freynaud: safari will be a challenge
[2013-09-02 04:01:17] freynaud: you cannot use instruments to launch it the way we did before on sim
[2013-09-02 05:51:47] freynaud: do NOT use ios-driver with ios7 :)
[2013-09-02 05:52:01] freynaud: it will corrupt your xcode install
[2013-09-02 05:55:45] dgrace: sounds like you learned the hard way!
[2013-09-02 05:59:30] freynaud: i thought it was the exiledSDK stuff
[2013-09-02 05:59:36] freynaud: so I search there
[2013-09-02 05:59:44] freynaud: turns out the problem was some place else
[2013-09-02 05:59:47] freynaud: :)

Any ideas why? I don't have the phone connected to the computer and want to use the ios simulator.
