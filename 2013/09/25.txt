[2013-09-25 12:12:53] lrvick: So I have been trying to get ios-driver to do with no luck
[2013-09-25 12:13:07] lrvick: sudo java -jar ios-server-0.6.3-jar-with-dependencies.jar -port 4444 -simulators
[2013-09-25 12:14:41] lrvick: that fires up ok and http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/capabilities/all dumps com.apple.mobiledafari on iphone(Simululator) blocks as i expect
[2013-09-25 12:14:46] lrvick: so far so good
[2013-09-25 12:16:50] lrvick: next a simple client in python: "from selenium import webdriver \n webdriver.Remote("http://localhost:4444/wd/hub",webdriver.DesiredCapabilties.IPHONE).get("http://google.com")"
[2013-09-25 12:19:15] nicegraham: Irvick: and then?
[2013-09-25 12:19:33] lukeis: no and then
[2013-09-25 12:19:38] lukeis: ;)
[2013-09-25 12:19:46] nicegraham: there he is
[2013-09-25 12:19:53] nicegraham: john python himself
[2013-09-25 12:19:53] lrvick: no love. Here is output: http://sprunge.us/gAab
[2013-09-25 12:20:12] lrvick: Very similar results fraom javacript or protractor
[2013-09-25 12:20:34] nicegraham: do you have xcode installed ok?
[2013-09-25 12:20:37] lukeis: what's this silly -simulators thing you've done nicegraham? ;)
[2013-09-25 12:20:40] lrvick: I have latest xcode and all simulators installed, stock and default
[2013-09-25 12:20:43] nicegraham: i know
[2013-09-25 12:20:46] lrvick: with latest cli tools
[2013-09-25 12:21:31] lrvick: At first it failued over until I realized i needed to add -simulators, which is not in the docs
[2013-09-25 12:21:37] lrvick: that got me further, wasted a few hours on that since i can
[2013-09-25 12:21:52] lrvick: t find it documented but then it at least shows me capabilties... but then no love.
[2013-09-25 12:22:07] lrvick: If i have a simulator running, it kills it when i get my traceback, if i don't have one running, it won't start one
[2013-09-25 12:22:34] nicegraham: that's thrown when it tries to write the plist
[2013-09-25 12:22:58] lrvick: I got tooons of unable to delete errors when i ran it without sudo. Figured permissions issues so said screw it and tried with sudo
[2013-09-25 12:23:08] lrvick: that got rid of the unable to delete errors buuut
[2013-09-25 12:23:39] nicegraham: ran what without sudo?
[2013-09-25 12:23:51] lrvick: sudo java -jar ios-server-0.6.3-jar-with-dependencies.jar -port 4444 -simulators
[2013-09-25 12:23:55] nicegraham: oh
[2013-09-25 12:24:04] nicegraham: you shoudln't have to do that
[2013-09-25 12:24:08] nicegraham: can you run
[2013-09-25 12:24:08] nicegraham:   sudo chmod 666 /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneSimulator.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneSimulator*.sdk/Applications/MobileSafari.app/Info.plist
[2013-09-25 12:24:19] lrvick: I figured however without sudo it gives me hundreds of unable to delete errors
[2013-09-25 12:24:21] lrvick: i ran that
[2013-09-25 12:24:43] nicegraham: what version of xcode are you on?
[2013-09-25 12:28:15] lrvick: 5.0
[2013-09-25 12:28:58] nicegraham: right
[2013-09-25 12:29:09] nicegraham: I know things have changed with 5.0
[2013-09-25 12:29:15] nicegraham: but I don't know exactly what
[2013-09-25 12:29:27] nicegraham: you'll have to clone the refactor branch in our repo
[2013-09-25 12:29:30] nicegraham: and run that
[2013-09-25 12:29:46] nicegraham: freynaud has been working on it
[2013-09-25 12:29:54] nicegraham: and I think it's nearly ready for release
[2013-09-25 12:30:06] lrvick: is there a jar floating around? I have not a clue how to compile a jar but I can learn if needed.
[2013-09-25 12:32:43] lrvick: or any notes on how to compile this on the cli would be awesome
[2013-09-25 12:33:43] nicegraham: I'm building it for you now
[2013-09-25 12:33:53] nicegraham: basically you just need to downloaad the repo
[2013-09-25 12:33:53] lrvick: ooh :D
[2013-09-25 12:34:04] nicegraham: and from the root directory run
[2013-09-25 12:34:05] nicegraham: mvn install -DskipTests
[2013-09-25 12:34:17] nicegraham: then you'll find the jar in the ./server/target folder
[2013-09-25 12:36:47] nicegraham: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/564974/ios-server-0.6.4-jar-with-dependencies-refactor-branch.jar
[2013-09-25 12:37:19] nicegraham: Irvick ^
[2013-09-25 12:37:32] lrvick: Awesome thanks
[2013-09-25 12:37:34] *lrvick tries'
[2013-09-25 12:38:23] nicegraham: if that doens't work you'll have to try and catch freynaud tomorrow
[2013-09-25 12:38:32] lrvick: my own just finished building. Teach a man to fish and all that.
[2013-09-25 12:38:37] nicegraham: he's been working on it - I've avoided upgrading
[2013-09-25 12:38:45] nicegraham: indeed!
[2013-09-25 12:39:10] nicegraham: you're on the right branch?
[2013-09-25 12:39:17] nicegraham: the default is dev
[2013-09-25 12:39:31] lrvick: yeah. checked out refactor and pulled the submodule
[2013-09-25 12:39:40] nicegraham: cool
[2013-09-25 12:39:45] nicegraham: well that's all I did
[2013-09-25 12:40:02] nicegraham: as I say if it doesn't work I'm pretty sure it's an xcode 5 issue
[2013-09-25 13:05:55] lrvick: nicegraham: freynaud sadly latest refactor blows up as well: http://sprunge.us/hHMK
[2013-09-25 13:06:56] nicegraham: looks like it's failing when it tries to write the settings
[2013-09-25 13:07:12] nicegraham: I'd guess it's a permissions thing - I just don't know where :)
