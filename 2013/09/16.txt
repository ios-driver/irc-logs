[2013-09-16 07:33:15] nirvdrum: nicegraham: I passed the flag.  Does it need a value?
[2013-09-16 07:33:26] nicegraham: no, just the flag
[2013-09-16 07:33:35] nirvdrum: That's what I thought.
[2013-09-16 07:33:49] nirvdrum: I found that out after realizing all my nodes registered to the grid without any browsers.
[2013-09-16 07:34:03] nirvdrum: That was pretty damn confusing.
[2013-09-16 07:34:21] nicegraham: yeah, I'd say so
[2013-09-16 07:34:32] nicegraham: apologies :)
[2013-09-16 07:34:48] nirvdrum: Especially for that to change in a point release.  As far as I could tell, there's no mention of it either.
[2013-09-16 07:35:12] nicegraham: it's part of the new libimobile stuff
[2013-09-16 07:35:21] nicegraham: you won't be tied to a mac to run real devices
[2013-09-16 07:35:40] nicegraham: so we need to be able to switch off the simulator stuff since that's mac specific
[2013-09-16 07:35:45] nirvdrum: That's fine.  It should have just been in 0.7.0 with a big warning in the release notes.
[2013-09-16 07:36:03] nirvdrum: But I didn't see any mention in the Safari section of the site, either.
[2013-09-16 07:36:14] nirvdrum: But, that's neither here nor there.
[2013-09-16 07:36:23] nicegraham: we need to update the docs
[2013-09-16 07:36:30] nirvdrum: As I mentioned in that issue, if either the locale or language is blank, the plist fails to write.
[2013-09-16 07:36:33] nicegraham: I was talking to freynaud on friday
[2013-09-16 07:36:59] nirvdrum: ios-driver re-wraps that exception in the one about the simulator not working.
[2013-09-16 07:37:06] nicegraham: that's if you pass DesiredCapabilities.iphone?
[2013-09-16 07:37:24] nirvdrum: Correct.  At least the one from ruby.
[2013-09-16 07:37:41] nicegraham: :) that's the other thing we wanted to check
[2013-09-16 07:37:50] nicegraham: how the ruby and python bindings are working
[2013-09-16 07:37:58] nicegraham: and getting some basic unit tests in for them
[2013-09-16 07:38:28] nirvdrum: But the client bindings shouldn't have to be updated to work with the latest ios-driver.
[2013-09-16 07:38:44] nirvdrum: (I'm also using the latest ruby binding, FWIW)
[2013-09-16 07:38:51] nicegraham: I'm not saying they should
[2013-09-16 07:39:04] nicegraham: just that the capabilities behave differently
[2013-09-16 07:39:26] nicegraham: we've had problems with the ruby ones before because they seem to be the strictest implementation
[2013-09-16 07:39:46] nirvdrum: So, they don't pass over either a locale or a language.
[2013-09-16 07:40:00] nirvdrum: I would think the safest thing is if they're null, just use whatever the system already has set up.
[2013-09-16 07:40:13] nicegraham: yeah, I think so
[2013-09-16 07:41:25] nirvdrum: Anyway, null guarding that allowed Safari to work perfectly fine for me.
[2013-09-16 07:41:34] nirvdrum: Using the "iPhone" and "iPad" capabilities.
[2013-09-16 07:41:47] nicegraham: did you commit that change?
[2013-09-16 07:45:22] nirvdrum: No.  I wanted to understand why this suddenly became a problem.
[2013-09-16 07:45:41] nirvdrum: I was git blaming the source and most of this hadn't been touched in over a year.
[2013-09-16 07:46:03] nicegraham: in our code or se?
[2013-09-16 07:55:43] psp250, joining. (#ios-driver)
[2013-09-16 08:07:15] nirvdrum: Ours.
[2013-09-16 08:15:52] nicegraham: so it's an se change
[2013-09-16 08:16:04] nicegraham: it was last time when they added that state / status field too
[2013-09-16 08:18:41] nirvdrum: What changed?
[2013-09-16 08:19:20] nirvdrum: From my perspective, I was running a 0.7.0-dev release from about 3 months ago and everything worked fine.  I switched to 0.6.4 and suddenly this locale thing became a problem.
[2013-09-16 08:19:28] nirvdrum: Using the same Selenium version.
[2013-09-16 08:19:47] nirvdrum: But, I'm missing whatever context during those 3 months3.
[2013-09-16 08:19:51] nirvdrum: *months.
[2013-09-16 08:33:28] nicegraham: the desiredcapability they added or made mandatory at least
[2013-09-16 08:33:42] nicegraham: state / status
[2013-09-16 08:33:46] nicegraham: not sure in this case
[2013-09-16 08:34:07] nicegraham: but if our code hasn't changed in that area it's unlikely to a problem on our side
[2013-09-16 08:34:16] *nicegraham is heading home'

[2013-09-16 08:58:04] lukeis: if we figure out the Firefox prebuilts in time ;)
[2013-09-16 09:02:37] nirvdrum: I'm trying to figure out why this is all of a sudden a problem: https://github.com/ios-driver/ios-driver/issues/142
[2013-09-16 09:02:58] nirvdrum: freynaud: Any ideas?
