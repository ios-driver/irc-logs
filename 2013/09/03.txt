[2013-09-03 10:05:05] smccarthy: Do I need java 7 for ios-server-0.6.3-jar-with-dependencies.jar ? It says "Unsupported major.minor version 51.0" when I start the ios-server. Using java 1.6.0_51 .
[2013-09-03 10:05:51] nirvdrum: Yes.
[2013-09-03 10:08:46] smccarthy: ok. I switched to java 7 and it started the server. I see my app under "Real device apps" at http://0.0.0.0:5555/wd/hub/applications/all , but at http://0.0.0.0:5555/wd/hub/status I see "supportedApps": [] . Any ideas ?
[2013-09-03 10:09:10] nirvdrum: Sorry.  All I've used ios-driver for is testing mobile Safari.
